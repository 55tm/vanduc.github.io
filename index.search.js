    "content": "Each Hugo page has to define a frontmatter.\nAll Frontmatter Options The values reflect example options. The defaults can be taken from the annotated example below.\n​\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r+++ +++\r--- ---\rAnnotated Frontmatter Options ​\rtoml\r+++ +++\rSome Detailed Examples Add Icon to a Menu Entry In the page frontmatter, add a menuPre param to insert any HTML code before the menu label. The example below uses the GitHub icon.\n​\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r+++ menuPre = \"\u003ci class='fab fa-github'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e \" title = 'GitHub repo' +++\r--- menuPre: '\u003ci class=''fab fa-github''\u003e\u003c/i\u003e ' title: GitHub repo ---\r{ \"menuPre\": \"\\u003ci class='fab fa-github'\\u003e\\u003c/i\\u003e \", \"title\": \"GitHub repo\" }\rOrdering Sibling Menu/Page Entries Hugo provides a flexible way to handle order for your pages.\nThe simplest way is to set weight parameter to a number.\n​\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r+++ title = 'My page' weight = 5 +++\r--- title: My page weight: 5 ---\r{ \"title\": \"My page\", \"weight\": 5 }\rUsing a Custom Title for Menu Entries By default, the Relearn theme will use a page’s title attribute for the menu item.\nBut a page’s title has to be descriptive on its own while the menu is a hierarchy. Hugo adds the linkTitle parameter for that purpose:\nFor example (for a page named content/install/linux.md):\n​\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r+++ linkTitle = 'Linux' title = 'Install on Linux' +++\r--- linkTitle: Linux title: Install on Linux ---\r{ \"linkTitle\": \"Linux\", \"title\": \"Install on Linux\" }\rOverride Expand State Rules for Menu Entries You can change how the theme expands menu entries on the side of the content with the alwaysopen setting on a per page basis. If alwaysopen=false for any given entry, its children will not be shown in the menu as long as it is not necessary for the sake of navigation.\nThe theme generates the menu based on the following rules:\nall parent entries of the active page including their siblings are shown regardless of any settings immediate children entries of the active page are shown regardless of any settings if not overridden, all other first level entries behave like they would have been given alwaysopen=false if not overridden, all other entries of levels besides the first behave like they would have been given alwaysopen=true all visible entries show their immediate children entries if alwaysopen=true; this proceeds recursively all remaining entries are not shown You can see this feature in action on the example page for children shortcode and its children pages.\nDisable Section Pages You may want to structure your pages in a hierachical way but don’t want to generate pages for those sections? The theme got you covered.\nTo stay with the initial example: Suppose you want level-one appear in the sidebar but don’t want to generate a page for it. So the entry in the sidebar should not be clickable but should show an expander.\nFor this, open content/level-one/_index.md and add the following frontmatter\n​\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r+++ collapsibleMenu = true [_build] render = 'never' +++\r--- _build: render: never collapsibleMenu: true ---\r{ \"_build\": { \"render\": \"never\" }, \"collapsibleMenu\": true }\r",

    "content": "This document shows you what’s new in the latest release and flags it with one of the following badges. For a detailed list of changes, see the history page.\n0.112.4 The minimum required Hugo version.\nBreaking A change that requires action by you after upgrading to assure the site is still functional.\nChange A change in default behavior that may requires action by you if you want to revert it.\nNew Marks new behavior you might find interesting or comes configurable.\n5.27.0.beta (XXXX-XX-XX) New You now can scroll forward and backward thru all headings of a page by using ALT + 🡑 and ALT + 🡓. This also works for the PRINT output format\nNew The breadcrumbs used in the topbar, search results and the taxonomy term lists are now using the pages frontmatter linktitle instead of title if set.\n5.26.0 (2024-03-18) New The lazy loading of images is now configurable by using the new lazy image effect. The default value hasn’t changed in comparison to older versions, you don’t need to change anything.\nNew It is now possible to adjust the max width of the main area, eg. in case you want to use the full page width for your content.\nNew Images and Codefences are now respecting Hugo’s Markdown attributes.\nNew The theme has updated its Mermaid dependency to 10.6.0. This adds support for block diagrams.\nNew This release fixes a long outstanding bug where the page wasn’t repositioning correctly when going forward or backward in your browser history.\n5.25.0 (2024-02-29) Change This release deprecates the attachments shortcode in favor of the new the resources shortcode.\nIf you are using Hugo below 0.123.0, you don’t need to change anything as the old shortcode still works (but may generate warnings).\nAnyways, users are strongly advised to migrate as the attachments shortcode will not receive support anymore. Migration instructions are listed on the attachments shortcode page.\nChange If you run Hugo with GitInfo configured, the default page footer now prints out name, email address and date of the last commit. If you want to turn this off you either have to run Hugo without GitInfo (which is the default) or overwrite the content-footer.html partial.\n5.24.0 (2024-02-28) 0.112.4 This release requires a newer Hugo version.\nChange The topbar button received a way to add text next to the icon. For this, the original title option was renamed to hint while the new title option is now displayed next to the icon.\nChange The frontmatter option menuTitle is now deprecated in favor for Hugo’s own linkTitle. You don’t need to change anything as the old menuTitle option is still supported.\nChange The light themes have a bit more contrast for content text and headings. Also the syntaxhighlighting was changed to the more colorful MonokaiLight. This brings the syntaxhighlightning in sync with the corresponding dark theme variants, which are using Monokai. If you dislike this, you can create your own color variant file as described here.\nNew If the theme can not resolve a link to a page or image, you can now generate warnings or errors during build by setting link.errorlevel or image.errorlevel to either warning or error in your hugo.toml respectively. By default this condition is silently ignored and the link is written as-is.\nPlease note that a page link will generate false negatives if uglyURLs=true and it references an ordinary page before 0.123.0.\nPlease note that an image link will generate false negatives if the file resides in your static directory.\nNew You now can configure additional options for every theme variant in your hugo.toml. This allows for optional advanced functionality. You don’t need to change anything as the old configuration options will still work (but may generate warnings now).\nThe advanced functionality allows you to set an explicit name for a theme variant and now allows for multiple auto mode variants that adjust to the light/dark preference of your OS settings.\nNew New partial for defining the heading. See documentation for further reading.\nNew Support for Hugo’s built-in figure shortcode.\nNew On taxonomy and term pages you can now use prev/next navigation as within the normal page structure.\nNew In additiion to the existing menu width customization, it is now also possible to set the width of the menu flyout for small screen sizes with the --MENU-WIDTH-S CSS property.\nNew Improvements for accessibility when tabbing thru the page for images, links and tab handles.\nNew The editURL config parameter is now overwritable in your pages frontmatter. In addition it received more versatility by letting you control where to put the file path into the URL. This is achieved by replacing the variable ${FilePath} in your URL by the pages file path. You don’t need to change anything in your existing configuration as the old way without the replacement variable still works.\nNew The themes config and frontmatter options received a comprehensive documentation update. In addition the theme switched from config.toml to hugo.toml.\nNew Restored compatibility with Hugo versions 0.121.0 or higher for the highlight shortcode. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\nNew Restored compatibility with Hugo versions 0.123.0 or higher for theme specific output formats and handling of taxonomy and term titles. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\n5.23.0 (2023-11-03) Change With 0.120.0 the author settings move into the [params] array in your hugo.toml. Because this collides with the previous way, the theme expected author information, it now adheres to Hugo standards and prints out a warning during built if something is wrong.\nChange your previous setting from\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[params] author = 'Hugo'\rparams: author: Hugo\r{ \"params\": { \"author\": \"Hugo\" } }\rto\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[params] [params.author] name = 'Hugo'\rparams: author: name: Hugo\r{ \"params\": { \"author\": { \"name\": \"Hugo\" } } }\rChange Taxonomy term pages now add the breadcrumb for each listed page. If this gets too crowded for you, you can turn the breadcrumbs off in your hugo.toml by adding disableTermBreadcrumbs=true.\nNew Taxonomy and term pages are now allowed to contain content. This is added inbetween the title and the page list.\nNew It is now possible to print custom taxonomies anywhere in your page. See the docs.\nNew It is now possible to adjust the menu width for your whole site. See the docs.\nNew This release adds social media meta tags for the Open Graph protocol and Twitter Cards to your site. See the docs.\nNew This release comes with additional sort options for the menu and the children shortcode. Both will now accept the following values: weight, title, linktitle, modifieddate, expirydate, publishdate, date, length or default (adhering to Hugo’s default sort order).\nNew The theme now provides a mechanism to load further JavaScript dependencies defined by you only if it is needed. This comes in handy if you want to add own shortcodes that depend on additional JavaScript code to be loaded. See the docs.\nNew The theme has updated its Mermaid dependency to 10.6.0. This adds support for the xychart type.\nNew This release adds portable Markdown links.\nPreviously it was not possible to use pure Markdown links in a configuration independend way to link to pages inside of your project. It always required you to know how your uglyURLs setting is, wheather you link to a page or page bundle and in case of relative links if your current page is a page or page bundle. (eg. [generator](generator/index.html) vs. [generator](generator.html)). This is a hassle as you have to change these links manually once you change your uglyURLs setting or change the type of a page.\nYou could work around this by using the relref shortcode (eg [generator]({{% relref \"../generator\" %}})) which works but results in non-portable Markdown.\nNow it’s possible to use the same path of a call to relref in a plain Markdown link (eg [generator](../generator)). This is independend of any configuration settings or the page types involved in linking. Note, that this requires your links to be given without any extension, so [generator](generator/index.html) will work as before.\nThe following types of linking are supported:\nlink description [generator](en/basics/generator) absolute from your project root (multilang) [generator](/en/basics/generator) absolute from your project root (multilang) [generator](basics/generator) absolute from your current language root [generator](/basics/generator) absolute from your current language root [generator](./../generator) relative from the current page [generator](../generator) relative from the current page 5.22.0 (2023-10-02) Change This release fixes an issue where in unfortunate conditions DOM ids generated by Hugo may collide with DOM ids set by the theme. To avoid this, all theme DOM ids are now prefixed with R-.\nIf you haven’t modified anything, everything is fine. Otherwise you have to check your custom CSS rules and JavaScript code.\nChange You can now have structural sections in the hierarchical menu without generating a page for it.\nThis can come in handy, if content for such a section page doesn’t make much sense to you. See the documentation for how to do this.\nThis feature may require you to make changes to your existing installation if you are already using shortcuts to pages inside of your project with a headless branch parent.\nIn this case it is advised to remove the title from the headless branch parent’s frontmatter, as it will otherwise appear in your breadcrumbs.\nNew It is now possible to overwrite the setting for collapsibleMenu of your hugo.toml inside of a page’s frontmatter.\nNew If a Mermaid graph is zoomable a button to reset the view is now added to the upper right corner. The button is only shown once the mouse is moved over the graph.\nNew It is now possible to remove the root breadcrumb by setting disableRootBreadcrumb=true in your hugo.toml.\nNew The output of the dedicated search page now displays the result’s breadcrumb.\nNew Table rows now change their background color on every even row.\nNew Translation into Swahili. This language is not supported for search.\n5.21.0 (2023-09-18) Change We made changes to the menu footer to improve alignment with the menu items in most cases. Care was taken not to break your existing overwritten footer. Anyways, if you have your menu-footer.html partial overridden, you may want to review the styling (eg. margins/paddings) of your partial.\nNew This release comes with an awesome new feature, that allows you to customize your topbar buttons, change behavior, reorder them or define entirely new ones, unique to your installation. See the documentation for further details.\nNew The theme has updated its Swagger dependency to 5.7.2 for the openapi shortcode. This brings support for OpenAPI Specification 3.1.\n5.20.0 (2023-08-26) Change The theme has updated its Swagger dependency to 5.4.1 for the openapi shortcode.\nWith this comes a change in the light theme variants of Relearn Bright, Relearn Light and Zen Light by switching the syntaxhighlightning inside of openapi to a light scheme. This brings it more in sync with the code style used by the theme variants itself.\nAdditionally, the syntaxhighlightning inside of openapi for printing was switched to a light scheme for all theme variants.\nIf you dislike this change, you can revert this in your theme variants CSS by adding\n--OPENAPI-CODE-theme: obsidian; --PRINT-OPENAPI-CODE-theme: obsidian; Change For consistency reasons, we renamed the CSS variable --MENU-SECTION-HR-color to --MENU-SECTION-SEPARATOR-color. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nNew The theme variants Zen Light and Zen Dark now add more contrast between menu, topbar and content by adding thin borders.\nThose borders are now configurable by using the CSS variables --MAIN-TOPBAR-BORDER-color, --MENU-BORDER-color, --MENU-TOPBAR-BORDER-color, --MENU-TOPBAR-SEPARATOR-color, --MENU-HEADER-SEPARATOR-color and --MENU-SECTION-ACTIVE-CATEGORY-BORDER-color.\nFor existing variants nothing has changed visually.\nNew The default values for the image effects are now configurable for your whole site via hugo.toml or for each page thru frontmatter.\nNew This release fixes a long outstanding bug where Mermaid graphs could not be displayed if they were initially hidden - like in collapsed expand or inactive tabs.\nNew Restored compatibility with Hugo versions lower than 0.111.0 for the highlight shortcode. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\n5.19.0 (2023-08-12) New The highlight shortcode now accepts the new parameter title. This displays the code like a single tab. This is also available using codefences and makes it much easier to write nicer code samples.\nNew The theme has added two new color variants zen-light and zen-dark. Check it out!\nNew The theme now dispatches the custom event themeVariantLoaded on the document when the variant is fully loaded either initially or by switching the variant manually with the variant selector.\nNew The theme has updated its Mermaid dependency to 10.3.1. This adds support for the sankey diagram type and now comes with full support for YAML inside Mermaid graphs (previously, the theme ignored explicit Mermaid theme settings in YAML).\nNew Translation into Hungarian.\n5.18.0 (2023-07-27) Change The theme adds additional warnings for deprecated or now unsupported features.\nChange There are visual improvements in displaying text links in your content aswell as to some other clickable areas in the theme. If you’ve overwritten some theme styles in your own CSS, keep this in mind.\nNew Restored compatibility with Hugo 0.95.0 or higher. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\nNew The siteparam shortcode is now capable in displaying nested params aswell as supporting text formatting.\n5.17.0 (2023-06-22) Change The default behavior for the copy-to-clipboard feature for code blocks has changed.\nThe copy-to-clipboard button for code blocks will now only be displayed if the reader hovers the code block.\nIf you dislike this new behavior you can turn it off and revert to the old behavior by adding [params] disableHoverBlockCopyToClipBoard=true to your hugo.toml.\nNew Restored compatibility with Hugo 0.114.0 or higher. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\nNew The new highlight shortcode replaces Hugo’s default implementation and is fully compatible. So you don’t need to change anything.\nIn addition it offers some extensions. Currently only the wrap extension option is provided to control whether a code block should be wrapped or scrolled if to long to fit.\n5.16.0 (2023-06-10) Change The theme now provides warnings for deprecated or now unsupported features. The warnings include hints how to fix them and an additional link to the documentation.\nDEPRECATION warnings mark features that still work but may be removed in the future.\nUNSUPPORTED warnings mark features that will not work anymore.\nChange The 404 error page was revamped. Hopefully you will not see this very often.\nNew The tabs shortcode and the tab shortcode received some love and now align with their style, color, title and icon parameter to the other shortcodes.\nThe visuals are now slightly different compared to previous versions. Most noteable, if you now display a single code block in a tab, its default styling will adapt to that of a code block but with a tab handle at the top.\nAdditionally the name parameter was renamed to title but you don’t need to change anything yet as the old name will be used as a fallback. Nevertheless you will get deprecation warnings while executing Hugo.\nNew The theme now optionally supports separate favicons for light \u0026 dark mode.\n5.15.0 (2023-05-29) Change Restored compatibility with Hugo 0.112.0 or higher. This does not change the minimum required Hugo version.\nThe attachments shortcode has compatibility issues with newer Hugo versions. You must switch to leaf bundles or are locked to Hugo \u003c 0.112.0 for now.\nIt is planned to refactor the attchments shortcode in the future. This will make it possible to use the shortcode in branch bundles again but not in simple pages anymore. This will most likely come with a breaking change.\nChange The tabs shortcode has changed behavior if you haven’t set the groupid parameter.\nFormerly all tab views without a groupid were treated as so they belong to the same group. Now, each tab view is treated as it was given a unique id.\nNew The already known tabshas a new friend the tab shortcode to make it easier to create a tab view in case you only need one single tab. Really handy if you want to flag your code examples with a language identifier.\nAdditionally for such a use case, the whitespace between a tab outline and the code is removed if only a single code block is contained.\nNew Besides the tag taxonomy the theme now also provides the category taxonomy out of the box and shows them in the content footer of each page.\n5.14.0 (2023-05-20) New The taxonomy pages received some love in this release, making them better leverage available screen space and adding translation support for the taxonomy names.\nHugo’s default taxonmies tags and categories are already contained in the theme’s i18n files. If you have self-defined taxonomies, you can add translations by adding them to your own i18n files. If you don’t provide translations, the singualar and plural forms are taken as configured in your hugo.toml.\nNew To give you more flexibility in customizing your article layout a new partial content-header.html is introduced.\nThis came out of the requirement to customize the position of article tags, which by default are displayed above the title. A second requirement was to also show additional taxonomies not supported by the theme natively. While Hugo supports tags and categories by default, the theme only displays tags.\nSo how to adjust the position of tags starting from the theme’s default where tags are only shown above the title?\nHide tags above title: Overwrite content-header.html with an empty file. Show tags between title and content: Overwrite heading-post.html and add {{ partial \"tags.html\" . }} to it. Show tags below content: Overwrite content-footer.html and add {{ partial \"tags.html\" . }} to it. New The new parameter breadcrumbSeparator is now available in your hugo.toml to change the - well - separator of the breadcrumb items. An appropriate default is in place if you do not configure anything.\n5.13.0 (2023-05-17) Change The swagger shortcode was deprecated in favor for the openapi shortcode. You don’t need to change anything yet as the old name will be used as a fallback. It is planned to remove the swagger shortcode in the next major release.\nAdditionally, the implemantion of this shortcode was switched from RapiDoc to SwaggerUI.\n5.12.0 (2023-05-04) Change In the effort to comply with WCAG standards, the implementation of the collapsible menu was changed (again). While Internet Explorer 11 has issues in displaying it, the functionality still works.\nNew Support for the great VSCode Front Matter extension which provides on-premise CMS capabilties to Hugo.\nThe theme provides Front Matter snippets for its shortcodes. Currently only English and German is supported. Put a reference into your frontmatter.json like this\n​\rfrontmatter.json\r{ ... \"frontMatter.extends\": [ \"./vscode-frontmatter/snippets.en.json\" ] ... }\rNew Support for languages that are written right to left (like Arabic) is now complete and extended to the menu, the top navigation bar and print. You can experience this in the pirate translation. This feature is not available in Internet Explorer 11.\nNew The scrollbars are now colored according to their variant color scheme to better fit into the visuals.\n5.11.0 (2023-02-07) Change The theme removed the popular jQuery library from its distribution.\nIn case you made changes to the theme that are dependend on this library you can place a copy of jQuery into your static/js directory and load it from your own layouts/partials/custom-header.html like this:\n​\rlayouts/partials/custom-header.html\r\u003cscript src=\"{{\"js/jquery.min.js\"| relURL}}\" defer\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\rChange Mermaid diagrams can now be configured for pan and zoom on site-, page-level or individually for each graph.\nThe default setting of on, in effect since 1.1.0, changed back to off as there was interference with scrolling on mobile and big pages.\nChange The theme is now capable to visually adapt to your OS’s light/dark mode setting.\nThis is also the new default setting if you haven’t configured themeVariant in your hugo.toml.\nAdditionally you can configure the variants to be taken for light/dark mode with the new themeVariantAuto parameter.\nThis is not supported for Internet Explorer 11, which still displays in the relearn-light variant.\nChange The JavaScript code for handling image lightboxes (provided by Featherlight) was replaced by a CSS-only solution.\nThis also changed the lightbox effects parameter from featherlight=false to lightbox=false. Nevertheless you don’t need to change anything as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nChange In the effort to comply with WCAG standards, the implementation of the expand shortcode was changed. While Internet Explorer 11 has issues in displaying it, the functionality still works.\nNew Translation into Czech. This language is not supported for search.\nNew GitHub releases are also now tagged for the main version (eg. 1.2.x), major version (eg. 1.x) and the latest (just x) release making it easier for you to pin the theme to a certain version.\n5.10.0 (2023-01-25) New The attachments, badge, button and notice shortcodes have a new parameter color to set arbitrary CSS color values.\nAdditionally the --ACCENT-color brand color introduced in version 5.8.0 is now supported with these shortcodes.\n5.9.0 (2022-12-23) Breaking With this version it is now possible to not only have sections on the first menu level but also pages.\nIt was later discovered, that this causes pages only meant to be displayed in the More section of the menu and stored directly inside your content directory to now show up in the menu aswell.\nTo get rid of this undesired behavior you have two choices:\nMake the page file a headless branch bundle (contained in its own subdirectory and called _index.md) and add the following frontmatter configuration to the file (see exampleSite’s content/showcase/_index.en.md). This causes its content to not be ontained in the sitemap.\n​\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r+++ title = 'Showcase' [_build] list = 'never' publishResources = true render = 'always' +++\r--- _build: list: never publishResources: true render: always title: Showcase ---\r{ \"_build\": { \"list\": \"never\", \"publishResources\": true, \"render\": \"always\" }, \"title\": \"Showcase\" }\rStore the page file for below a parent headless branch bundle and add the following frontmatter to he parent (see exampleSite’s content/more/_index.en.md). Don’t give this page a title as this will cause it to be shown in the breadcrumbs - a thing you most likely don’t want.\n​\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r+++ [_build] list = 'never' publishResources = false render = 'never' +++\r--- _build: list: never publishResources: false render: never ---\r{ \"_build\": { \"list\": \"never\", \"publishResources\": false, \"render\": \"never\" } }\rIn this case, the file itself can be a branch bundle, leaf bundle or simple page (see exampleSite’s content/more/credits.en.md). This causes its content to be contained in the sitemap.\n​\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r+++ title = 'Credits' +++\r--- title: Credits ---\r{ \"title\": \"Credits\" }\rChange The required folder name for the attachments shortcode was changed for leaf bundles.\nPreviously, the attachments for leaf bundles in non-multilang setups were required to be in a files subdirectory. For page bundles and leaf bundles in multilang setups they were always required to be in a _index.\u003cLANGCODE\u003e.files or index.\u003cLANGCODE\u003e.files subdirectory accordingly.\nThis added unnecessary complexity. So attachments for leaf bundles in non-multilang setups can now also reside in a index.files directory. Although the old files directory is now deprecated, if both directories are present, only the old files directory will be used for compatibility.\nChange Absolute links prefixed with http:// or https:// are now opened in a separate browser tab.\nYou can revert back to the old behavior by defining externalLinkTarget=\"_self\" in the params section of your hugo.toml.\nNew The theme now supports Hugo’s module system.\n5.8.0 (2022-12-08) New The new badge shortcode is now available to add highly configurable markers to your content as you can see it on this page.\nNew The new icon shortcode simplyfies the usage of icons. This can even be combined with also new badge shortcode.\nNew The theme now supports some of GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) syntax and Hugo Markdown extensions, namely task lists, defintion lists and footnotes.\nNew A new color --ACCENT-color was introduced which is used for highlightning search results on the page. In case you simply don’t care, you don’t need to change anything in your variant stylesheet as the old yellow color is still used as default.\n5.7.0 (2022-11-29) Change The Korean language translation for this theme is now available with the language code ko. Formerly the country code kr was used instead.\nNew The button shortcode can now also be used as a real button inside of HTML forms - although this is a pretty rare use case. The documentation was updated accordingly.\nNew The search now supports the Korean language.\n5.6.0 (2022-11-18) New This release introduces an additional dedicated search page. On this page, displayed search results have more space making it easier scanning thru large number of results.\nTo activate this feature, you need to configure it in your hugo.toml as a new outputformat searchpage for the home page. If you don’t configure it, no dedicated search page will be accessible and the theme works as before.\nYou can access the search page by either clicking on the magnifier glass or pressing enter inside of the search box.\nNew Keyboard handling for the TOC and search was improved.\nPressing CTRL+ALT+t now will not only toggle the TOC overlay but also places the focus to the first heading on opening. Subsequently this makes it possible to easily select headings by using the TAB key.\nThe search received its own brand new keyboard shortcut CTRL+ALT+f. This will focus the cursor inside of the the search box so you can immediately start your search by typing.\nNew You are now able to turn off the generation of generator meta tags in your HTML head to hide the used versions of Hugo and this theme.\nTo configure this in your hugo.toml make sure to set Hugo’s disableHugoGeneratorInject=true and also [params] disableGeneratorVersion=true, otherwise Hugo will generate a meta tag into your home page automagically.\nNew Creation of your project gets a little bit faster with this release.\nThis addresses increased build time with the 5.x releases. The theme now heavily caches partial results leading to improved performance. To further increase performance, unnecessary parts of the page are now skipped for creation of the print output (eg. menus, navigation bar, etc.).\n5.5.0 (2022-11-06) Change The way images are processed has changed. Now images are lazy loaded by default which speeds up page load on slow networks and/or big pages and also the print preview.\nFor that the JavaScript code to handle the lightbox and image effects on the client side was removed in favour for static generation of those effects on the server.\nIf you have used HTML directly in your Markdown files, this now has the downside that it doesn’t respect the effect query parameter anymore. In this case you have to migrate all your HTML img URLs manually to the respective HTML attributes.\nOld New \u003cimg src=\"pic.png?width=20vw\u0026classes=shadow,border\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"pic.png\" style=\"width:20vw;\" class=\"shadow border\"\u003e 5.4.0 (2022-11-01) Change With the proper settings in your hugo.toml your page is now servable from the local file system using file:// URLs.\nPlease note that the searchbox will only work for this if you reconfigure your outputformat for the homepage in your hugo.toml from json to search. The now deprecated json outputformat still works as before, so there is no need to reconfigure your installation if it is only served from http:// or https://.\nChange The button shortcode has a new parameter target to set the destination frame/window for the URL to open. If not given, it defaults to a new window/tab for external URLs or is not set at all for internal URLs. Previously even internal URLs where opened in a new window/tab.\nNew The math shortcode and mermaid shortcode now also support the align parameter if codefence syntax is used.\nNew Support for languages that are written right to left (like Arabic). This is only implemented for the content area but not the navigation sidebar. This feature is not available in Internet Explorer 11.\nNew Translation into Finnish (Suomi).\n5.3.0 (2022-10-07) Change In the effort to comply with WCAG standards, the implementation of the collapsible menu was changed. The functionality of the new implementation does not work with old browsers (Internet Explorer 11).\nNew Image formatting has two new classes to align images to the left or right. Additionally, the already existing inline option is now documented.\nNew Printing for the swagger shortcode was optimized to expand sections that are usually closed in interactive mode. This requires print support to be configured.\n5.2.0 (2022-08-03) Change If you’ve set collapsibleMenu = true in your hugo.toml, the menu will be expanded if a search term is found in a collapsed submenu. The menu will return to its initial collapse state once the search term does not match any submenus. 5.1.0 (2022-07-15) 0.95.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version.\nChange Because the print preview URLs were non deterministic for normal pages in comparison to page bundles, this is now changed. Each print preview is now accessible by adding a index.print.html to the default URL.\nYou can revert this behavior by overwriting the print output format setting in your hugo.tomlto:\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[outputFormats] [outputFormats.print] baseName = 'index' isHTML = true mediaType = 'text/html' name = 'print' path = '_print' permalinkable = false\routputFormats: print: baseName: index isHTML: true mediaType: text/html name: print path: _print permalinkable: false\r{ \"outputFormats\": { \"print\": { \"baseName\": \"index\", \"isHTML\": true, \"mediaType\": \"text/html\", \"name\": \"print\", \"path\": \"_print\", \"permalinkable\": false } } }\r5.0.0 (2022-07-05) Breaking The theme changed how JavaScript and CSS dependencies are loaded to provide a better performance. In case you’ve added own JavaScript code that depends on the themes jQuery implementation, you have to put it into a separate *.js file (if not already) and add the defer keyword to the script element. Eg.\n\u003cscript defer src=\"myscript.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e Change The way archetypes are used to generate output has changed. The new systems allows you, to redefine existing archetypes or even generate your own ones.\nYour existing markdown files will still work like before and therefore you don’t need to change anything after the upgrade. Nevertheless, it is recommended to adapt your existing markdown files to the new way as follows:\nfor your home page, add the frontmatter parameter archetype = \"home\" and remove the leading heading\nfor all files containing the deprecated frontmatter parameter chapter = true, replace it with archetype = \"chapter\" and remove the leading headings\nChange The frontmatter options pre / post were renamed to menuPre / menuPost. The old options will still be used if the new options aren’t set. Therefore you don’t need to change anything after the upgrade.\nNew Adding new partials heading-pre.html / heading-post.html and according frontmatter options headingPre / headingPost to modify the way your page`s main heading gets styled.\nNew The new shortcode math is available to add beautiful math and chemical formulae. See the documentation for available features. This feature will not work with Internet Explorer 11.\n4.2.0 (2022-06-23) Breaking The second parameter for the include shortcode was switched in meaning and was renamed from showfirstheading to hidefirstheading. If you haven’t used this parameter in your shortcode, the default behavior hasn’t changed and you don’t need to change anything.\nIf you’ve used the second boolean parameter, you have to rename it and invert its value to achieve the same behavior.\nChange Previously, if the tabs shortcode could not find a tab item because, the tabs ended up empty. Now the first tab is selected instead.\nChange The landingPageURL was removed from hugo.toml. You can safely remove this as well from your configuration as it is not used anymore. The theme will detect the landing page URL automatically and will point to the project’s homepage. If you want to support a different link, overwrite the logo.html partial.\nNew All shortcodes can now be also called from your partials. Examples for this are added to the documentation of each shortcode.\n4.1.0 (2022-06-12) New While fixing issues with the search functionality for non Latin languages, you can now configure to have multiple languages on a single page. 4.0.0 (2022-06-05) Breaking The custom_css config parameter was removed from the configuration. If used in an existing installation, it can be achieved by overriding the custom-header.html template in a much more generic manner.\nBreaking Because anchor hover color was not configurable without introducing more complexity to the variant stylesheets, we decided to remove --MAIN-ANCHOR-color instead. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the anchors now get their colors from --MAIN-LINK-color and --MAIN-ANCHOR-HOVER-color respectively.\nNew All shortcodes now support named parameter. The positional parameter are still supported but will not be enhanced with new features, so you don’t need to change anything in your installation.\nThis applies to expand, include, notice and siteparam.\nNew The button shortcode received some love and now has a parameter for the color style similar to other shortcodes.\nNew New colors --PRIMARY-color and --SECONDARY-color were added to provide easier modification of your custom style. Shortcodes with a color style can now have primary or secondary as additional values.\nThese two colors are the default for other, more specific color variables. You don’t need to change anything in your existing custom color stylesheets as those variables get reasonable default values.\nNew Translation into Polish. This language is not supported for search.\nNew The documentation for all shortcodes were revised.\n3.4.0 (2022-04-03) Breaking If you had previously overwritten the custom-footer.html partial to add visual elements below the content of your page, you have to move this content to the new partial content-footer.html. custom-footer.html was never meant to contain HTML other than additional styles and JavaScript.\nNew If you prefer expandable/collapsible menu items, you can now set collapsibleMenu=true in your hugo.toml. This will add arrows to all menu items that contain sub menus. The menu will expand/collapse without navigation if you click on an arrow.\nNew You can activate print support in your hugo.toml to add the capability to print whole chapters or even the complete site.\nNew Translation into Traditional Chinese.\n3.3.0 (2022-03-28) New Introduction of new CSS variables to set the font. The theme distinguishes between --MAIN-font for all content text and --CODE-font for inline or block code. There are additional overrides for all headings. See the theme variant generator of the exampleSite for all available variables.\nNew The new shortcode swagger is available to include a UI for REST OpenAPI specifications. See the documentation for available features. This feature will not work with Internet Explorer 11.\n3.2.0 (2022-03-19) 0.93.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version.\nChange In this release the Mermaid JavaScript library will only be loaded on demand if the page contains a Mermaid shortcode or is using Mermaid codefences. This changes the behavior of disableMermaid config option as follows: If a Mermaid shortcode or codefence is found, the option will be ignored and Mermaid will be loaded regardlessly.\nThe option is still useful in case you are using scripting to set up your graph. In this case no shortcode or codefence is involved and the library is not loaded by default. In this case you can set disableMermaid=false in your frontmatter to force the library to be loaded. See the theme variant generator of the exampleSite for an example.\nNew Additional color variant variable --MERMAID-theme to set the variant’s Mermaid theme. This causes the Mermaid theme to switch with the color variant if it defers from the setting of the formerly selected color variant.\n3.1.0 (2022-03-15) New attachment and notice shortcodes have a new parameter to override the default icon. Allowed values are all Font Awesome 5 Free icons. 3.0.0 (2022-02-22) Breaking We made changes to the menu footer. If you have your menu-footer.html partial overridden, you may have to review the styling (eg. margins/paddings) in your partial. For a reference take a look into the menu-footer.html partial that is coming with the exampleSite.\nThis change was made to allow your own menu footer to be placed right after the so called prefooter that comes with the theme (containing the language switch and Clear history functionality).\nBreaking We have changed the default colors from the original Learn theme (the purple menu header) to the Relearn defaults (the light green menu header) as used in the official documentation.\nThis change will only affect your installation if you’ve not set the themeVariant parameter in your hugo.toml. If you still want to use the Learn color variant, you have to explicitly set themeVariant=\"learn\" in your hugo.toml.\nNote, that this will also affect your site if viewed with Internet Explorer 11 but in this case it can not be reconfigured as Internet Explorer does not support CSS variables.\nChange Due to a bug, that we couldn’t fix in a general manner for color variants, we decided to remove --MENU-SEARCH-BOX-ICONS-color and introduced --MENU-SEARCH-color instead. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nChange For consistency reasons, we renamed --MENU-SEARCH-BOX-color to --MENU-SEARCH-BORDER-color. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nNew With this release you are now capable to define your own dark mode variants.\nTo make this possible, we have introduced a lot more color variables you can use in your color variants. Your old variants will still work and don’t need to be changed as appropriate fallback values are used by the theme. Nevertheless, the new colors allow for much more customization.\nTo see what’s now possible, see the new variants relearn-dark and neon that are coming with this release.\nNew To make the creation of new variants easier for you, we’ve added a new interactive theme variant generator. This feature will not work with Internet Explorer 11.\nNew You can now configure multiple color variants in your hugo.toml. In this case, the first variant is the default chosen on first view and a variant selector will be shown in the menu footer. See the documentation for configuration.\nNote, that the new variant selector will not work with Internet Explorer 11 as it does not support CSS variables. Therefore, the variant selector will not be displayed with Internet Explorer 11.\n2.9.0 (2021-11-19) Breaking This release removes the themes implementation of ref/relref in favor for Hugos standard implementation. This is because of inconsistencies with the themes implementation. In advantage, your project becomes standard compliant and exchanging this theme in your project to some other theme will be effortless.\nIn a standard compliant form you must not link to the *.md file but to its logical name. You’ll see, referencing other pages becomes much easier. All three types result in the same reference:\nType Non-Standard Standard Branch bundle basics/configuration/_index.md basics/configuration Leaf bundle basics/configuration/index.md basics/configuration Page basics/configuration.md basics/configuration If you’ve linked from a page of one language to a page of another language, conversion is a bit more difficult but Hugo got you covered as well.\nAlso, the old themes implementation allowed refs to non-existing content. This will cause Hugos implementation to show the error below and abort the generation. If your project relies on this old behavior, you can reconfigure the error handling of Hugos implementation.\nIn the best case your usage of the old implementation is already standard compliant and you don’t need to change anything. You’ll notice this very easily once you’ve started hugo server after an upgrade and no errors are written to the console.\nYou may see errors on the console after the update in the form:\nERROR 2021/11/19 22:29:10 [en] REF_NOT_FOUND: Ref \"basics/configuration/_index.md\": \"hugo-theme-relearn\\exampleSite\\content\\_index.en.md:19:22\": page not foundIn this case, you must apply one of two options:\nStart up a text editor with regular expression support for search and replace. Search for (ref\\s+\"[^\"]*?)(?:/_index|/index)?(?:\\.md)?(#[^\"]*?)?\" and replace it by $1$2\" in all *.md files. This is the recommended choice.\nCopy the old implementation files theme/hugo-theme-relearn/layouts/shortcode/ref.html and theme/hugo-theme-relearn/layouts/shortcode/relref.html to your own projects layouts/shortcode/ref.html and layouts/shortcode/relref.html respectively. This is not recommended as your project will still rely on non-standard behavior afterwards.\n2.8.0 (2021-11-03) Change Although never officially documented, this release removes the font Novacento/Novecento. If you use it in an overwritten CSS please replace it with Work Sans. This change was necessary as Novacento did not provide all Latin special characters and lead to mixed styled character text eg. for Czech.\nNew The theme now supports favicons served from static/images/ named as favicon or logo in SVG, PNG or ICO format out of the box. An overridden partial layouts/partials/favicon.html may not be necessary anymore in most cases.\nNew You can hide the table of contents menu for the whole site by setting the disableToc option in your hugo.toml. For an example see the example configuration.\n2.7.0 (2021-10-24) New Optional second parameter for notice shortcode to set title in box header. 2.6.0 (2021-10-21) New Your site can now be served from a subfolder if you set baseURL in your hugo.toml. See the documentation for a detailed example. 2.5.0 (2021-10-08) Change New colors --CODE-BLOCK-color and --CODE-BLOCK-BG-color were added to provide a fallback for Hugos syntax highlighting in case no language was given or the language is unsupported. Ideally the colors are set to the same values as the ones from your chosen chroma style. 2.4.0 (2021-10-07) Change Creation of customized stylesheets was simplified down to only contain the CSS variables. Everything else can and should be deleted from your custom stylesheet to assure everything works fine. For the predefined stylesheet variants, this change is already included.\nNew Hidden pages are displayed by default in their according tags page. You can now turn off this behavior by setting disableTagHiddenPages=true in your hugo.toml.\nNew You can define the expansion state of your menus for the whole site by setting the alwaysopen option in your hugo.toml. Please see further documentation for possible values and default behavior.\nNew New frontmatter ordersectionsby option to change immediate children sorting in menu and children shortcode. Possible values are title or weight.\nNew Alternate content of a page is now advertised in the HTML meta tags. See Hugo documentation.\n2.3.0 (2021-09-13) 0.81.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version.\nNew Showcase multilanguage features by providing a documentation translation “fer us pirrrates”. There will be no other translations besides the original English one and the Pirates one due to maintenance constraints.\n2.2.0 (2021-09-09) New Hidden pages are displayed by default in the sitemap generated by Hugo and are therefore visible for search engine indexing. You can now turn off this behavior by setting disableSeoHiddenPages=true in your hugo.toml. 2.1.0 (2021-09-07) 0.69.0 This release requires a newer Hugo version.\nChange In case the site’s structure contains additional *.md files not part of the site (eg files that are meant to be included by site pages - see CHANGELOG.md in the exampleSite), they will now be ignored by the search.\nNew Hidden pages are indexed for the site search by default. You can now turn off this behavior by setting disableSearchHiddenPages=true in your hugo.toml.\nNew If a search term is found in an expand shortcode, the expand will be opened.\nNew The menu will scroll the active item into view on load.\n2.0.0 (2021-08-28) Change Syntax highlighting was switched to the built in Hugo mechanism. You may need to configure a new stylesheet or decide to roll you own as described on in the Hugo documentation\nChange In the predefined stylesheets there was a typo and --MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVERED-color must be changed to --MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVER-color. You don’t need to change anything in your custom color stylesheet as the old name will be used as a fallback.\nChange --MENU-HOME-LINK-color and --MENU-HOME-LINK-HOVER-color were missing in the documentation. You should add them to your custom stylesheets if you want to override the defaults.\nChange Arrow navigation and children shortcode were ignoring setting for ordersectionsby. This is now changed and may result in different sorting order of your sub pages.\nChange If hidden pages are accessed directly by typing their URL, they will be exposed in the menu.\nChange A page without a title will be treated as hidden=true.\nNew You can define the expansion state of your menus in the frontmatter. Please see further documentation for possible values and default behavior.\nNew New partials for defining pre/post content for menu items and the content. See documentation for further reading.\nNew Shortcode children with new parameter containerstyle.\nNew New shortcode include to include arbitrary file content into a page.\n1.2.0 (2021-07-26) New Shortcode expand with new parameter to open on page load. 1.1.0 (2021-07-02) Breaking Mermaid diagrams can now be panned and zoomed. This isn’t configurable yet.\nNew Mermaid config options can be set in hugo.toml.\n1.0.0 (2021-07-01) 0.65.0 The requirement for the Hugo version of this theme is the same as for the Learn theme version 2.5.0 on 2021-07-01.\nNew Initial fork of the Learn theme based on Learn 2.5.0 on 2021-07-01. This introduces no new features besides a global rename to Relearn and a new logo. For the reasons behind forking the Learn theme, see this comment in the Learn issues.\n",

    "content": "Using the command: hugo new [relative new content path], you can start a content file with the date and title automatically set. While this is a welcome feature, active writers need more: archetypes. These are preconfigured skeleton pages with default frontmatter.\nThe Relearn theme defines some few archetypes of pages but you are free to define new ones to your liking. All can be used at any level of the documentation, the only difference being the layout of the content.\nPredefined Archetypes Home A Home page is the starting page of your project. It’s best to have only one page of this kind in your project.\nTo create a home page, run the following command\nhugo new --kind home _index.mdThis leads to a file with the following content\n​\r_index.md\r+++ archetype = \"home\" title = \"{{ replace .Name \"-\" \" \" | title }}\" +++ Lorem Ipsum.\rChapter A Chapter displays a page meant to be used as introduction for a set of child pages. Commonly, it contains a simple title and a catch line to define content that can be found below it.\nTo create a chapter page, run the following command\nhugo new --kind chapter \u003cname\u003e/_index.mdThis leads to a file with the following content\n​\r_index.md\r+++ archetype = \"chapter\" title = \"{{ replace .Name \"-\" \" \" | title }}\" weight = 1 +++ Lorem Ipsum.\rThe weight number will be used to generate the subtitle of the chapter page, set the number to a consecutive value starting at 1 for each new chapter level.\nDefault A Default page is any other content page. If you set an unknown archetype in your frontmatter, this archetype will be used to generate the page.\nTo create a default page, run either one of the following commands\nhugo new \u003cchapter\u003e/\u003cname\u003e/_index.mdor\nhugo new \u003cchapter\u003e/\u003cname\u003e.mdThis leads to a file with the following content\n​\r*.md\r+++ title = \"{{ replace .Name \"-\" \" \" | title }}\" +++ Lorem Ipsum.\rSelf defined Archetypes If you are in need of further archetypes you can define your own or even redefine existing ones.\nTemplate Define a template file in your project at archetypes/\u003ckind\u003e.md and make sure it has at least the frontmatter parameter for that archetype like\n​\r\u003ckind\u003e.md\r+++ archetype = \"\u003ckind\u003e\" +++\rAfterwards you can generate new content files of that kind with the following command\nhugo new --kind \u003ckind\u003e \u003cname\u003e/_index.mdPartials To define how your archetypes are rendered, define corresponding partial files in your projects directory layouts/partials/archetypes/\u003ckind\u003e.\nIf you use an unknown archetype in your frontmatter, the default archetype will be used to generate the page.\nRelated to each archetype, several hook partial files in the form of \u003chook\u003e.html can be given inside each archetype directory. If a partial for a specific hook is missing, no output is generated for this hook.\nThe following hooks are used:\nName Notes styleclass Defines a set of CSS classes to be added to the HTML’s \u003cmain\u003e element. You can use these classes to define own CSS rules in your custom-header.html article Defines the HTML how to render your content Take a look at the existing archetypes of this theme to get an idea how to utilize it.\nOutput formats Each hook file can be overridden of a specific output format. Eg. if you define a new output format PLAINTEXT in your hugo.toml, you can add a file layouts/partials/archetypes/default.plaintext.html to change the way how normal content is written for that output format.\n",

    "content": "Let’s face it: Writing content for the web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.\nMarkdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.\nSome of the key benefits are:\nMarkdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid HTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:\nThe overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. John Gruber\nWithout further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like:\nTip\rBookmark this page and the official Commonmark reference for easy future reference!\nParagraphs In Markdown your content usually spans the whole available document width. This is called a block. Blocks are always separated by whitespace to their adjacent blocks in the resulting document.\nAny text not starting with a special sign is written as normal, plain text paragraph block and must be separated to its adjacent blocks by empty lines.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad.\rResult\rLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus.\nEt legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad.\nHeadings A good idea is to structure your content using headings and subheadings. HTML-headings from h1 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level.\nIn Hugo you usually don’t use h1 as this is generated by your theme and you should only have one such element in a document.\n# h1 Heading ## h2 Heading ### h3 Heading #### h4 Heading ##### h5 Heading ###### h6 Heading\rResult\rh1 Heading h2 Heading h3 Heading h4 Heading h5 Heading h6 Heading Horizontal Rules To further structure your content you can add horizontal rules. They create a “thematic break” between paragraph blocks. In Markdown, you can create it with three consecutive dashes ---.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. --- Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum.

A footnote is made of two things, a marker in the text that will become a superscript number and a footnote definition that will be placed in a list of footnotes.\nUsually the list of footnotes will be shown at the end of your document. If we use a footnote in a notice box it will instead be listed at the end of its box.\nFootnotes can contain block elements, which means that you can put multiple paragraphs, lists, blockquotes and so on in a footnote. It works the same as for list items, just indent the following paragraphs by four spaces in the footnote definition.\nThat's some text with a footnote[^1] [^1]: And that's the footnote.

Feel free to contribute! Full support for languages written right to left Automatic menu generation from multilingual content In-browser language switching Basic configuration After learning how Hugo handle multilingual websites, define your languages in your hugo.toml file.\nFor example with current English and Piratized English website.\nNote\rMake sure your default language is defined as the first one in the [languages] array, as the theme needs to make assumptions on it\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\rdefaultContentLanguage = 'en' [languages] [languages.en] languageName = 'English' title = 'Hugo Relearn Theme' weight = 1 [languages.pir] languageName = 'Arrr!

It’s not replaced with default language content.\nTip\rUse slug frontmatter parameter to translate urls too.\nSearch In case each page’s content is written in one single language only, the above configuration will already configure the site’s search functionality correctly.\nWarning\rAlthough the theme supports a wide variety of supported languages, the site’s search via the Lunr search library does not. You’ll see error reports in your browsers console log for each unsupported language. Currently unsupported are:\nCzech Indonesian Polish Swahili Search with mixed language support In case your page’s content contains text in multiple languages (e.g. you are writing a Russian documentation for your english API), you can add those languages to your hugo.toml to broaden search.\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[params] additionalContentLanguage = ['en']\rparams: additionalContentLanguage: - en\r{ \"params\": { \"additionalContentLanguage\": [ \"en\" ] } }\rAs this is an array, you can add multiple additional languages.\nNote\rKeep in mind that the language code required here, is the base language code. E.g. if you have additional content in zh-CN, you have to add just zh to this parameter.\nOverwrite translation strings Translations strings are used for common default values used in the theme (Edit button, Search placeholder and so on). Translations are available in English and Piratized English but you may use another language or want to override default values.\nTo override these values, create a new file in your local i18n folder i18n/\u003cidlanguage\u003e.toml and inspire yourself from the theme themes/hugo-theme-relearn/i18n/en.toml\nDisable language switching Switching the language in the browser is a great feature, but for some reasons you may want to disable it.\nJust set disableLanguageSwitchingButton=true in your hugo.toml\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[params] disableLanguageSwitchingButton = true\rparams: disableLanguageSwitchingButton: true\r{ \"params\": { \"disableLanguageSwitchingButton\": true } }\r",

If you don’t know Hugo at all, we strongly suggest you learn more about it by following this great documentation for beginners.\nTip\rThe following tutorial leads you thru the steps of creating a first, minimal new site.\nYou don’t need to edit any files besides your hugo.toml and only need to execute the commands in the given order.\nCreate your project Hugo provides a new command to create a new website:\nhugo new site my-new-siteAfter that change into the directory:\ncd my-new-siteEvery upcoming command will be executed from inside your new site’s root.\nInstall the theme From Download You can download the theme as .zip file and extract it into them themes/hugo-theme-relearn directory.\nWith Hugo’s Module System Install the Relearn theme by following this documentation using Hugo’s module system.\nThis theme’s repository is: https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn.git\nUsing Git or Git Submodules If you install the theme from your git repository or GitHub, you have several options.\nIf you use the head of the main branch, you are using the development version. Usually it is fully functional but can break from time to time. We try to fix newly introduced bugs in this version as soon as possible.\nAdditionally you can checkout one of the tagged versions. These tagged versions correspond to an official releases from the GitHub repository.\nBesides the usual version tags (eg 1.2.3) there are also tags for the main version (eg. 1.2.x), major version (eg. 1.x) and the latest (just x) released version making it easier for you to pin the theme to a certain version.\nBasic Configuration When building the website, you can set a theme by using --theme option. However, we suggest you modify the configuration file hugo.toml and set the theme as the default.\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\rtheme = 'hugo-theme-relearn'\rtheme: hugo-theme-relearn\r{ \"theme\": \"hugo-theme-relearn\" }\rCreate your Home Page If you don’t create a home page, yet, the theme will generate a placeholder text with instructions how to proceed.\nStart your journey by filling the home page with content\nhugo new --kind home _index.mdBy opening the given file, you should see the property archetype=home on top, meaning this page is a home page. The Relearn theme provides some archetypes to create those skeleton files for your website.\nObviously you better should change the page’s content.\nCreate your First Chapter Page Chapters are pages that contain other child pages. It has a special layout style and usually just contains the title and a brief abstract of the section.\n# Basics Discover what this Hugo theme is all about and the core concepts behind it.renders as\nBegin by creating your first chapter page with the following command:\nhugo new --kind chapter basics/_index.mdBy opening the given file, you should see the property archetype=chapter on top, meaning this page is a chapter.\nThe weight number will be used to generate the subtitle of the chapter page, set the number to a consecutive value starting at 1 for each new chapter level.\nCreate your First Content Pages Then, create content pages inside the previously created chapter. Here are two ways to create content in the chapter:\nhugo new basics/first-content.md hugo new basics/second-content/_index.mdFeel free to edit those files by adding some sample content and replacing the title value in the beginning of the files.\nLaunching the Website Locally Launch by using the following command:\nhugo serveGo to http://localhost:1313\nYou should notice three things:\nThe home page contains some basic text. You have a left-side Basics menu, containing two submenus with names equal to the title properties in the previously created files. When you run hugo serve your page refreshes automatically when you change a content page. Neat! Build the Website When your site is ready to deploy, run the following command:\nhugoA public folder will be generated, containing all content and assets for your website. It can now be deployed on any web server.\nNow it’s time to deploy your page by simply uploading your project to some webserver or by using one of Hugo’s many deployment options.\n",

    "content": "The Relearn theme provides configuration options to change your your site’s colors, favicon and logo. This allows you to easily align your site visuals to your desired style. Most of these options are exposed thru so called color variants.\nA color variant lets you customize various visual effects of your site like almost any color, used fonts, color schemes of print, syntax highligtning, Mermaid and the OpenAPI shortcode, etc. It contains of a CSS file and optional configuration options in your hugo.toml.\nThe Relearn theme ships with a wide set of different color variants. You can use them as-is, copy them over and use them as a starting point for your customizations or just create completely new variants unique to your site. The interactive variant generator may help you with this task.\nOnce configured in your hugo.toml, you can select them with the variant selector at the bottom of the menu.\nChange the Variant (Simple) Single Variant Set the themeVariant value to the name of your theme file. That’s it! Your site will be displayed in this variant only.\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[params] themeVariant = 'relearn-light'\rparams: themeVariant: relearn-light\r{ \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": \"relearn-light\" } }\rNote\rYour theme variant file must reside in your site’s static/css directory or in the theme’s static/css directory and the file name must start with theme- and end wit .css. In the above example, the path of your theme file must be static/css/theme-relearn-light.css.\nIf you want to make changes to a shipped color variant, create a copy in your site’s static/css directory. Don’t edit the file in the theme’s directory!\nMultiple Variants You can also set multiple variants. In this case, the first variant is the default chosen on first view and a variant selector will be shown in the menu footer if the array contains more than one entry.\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[params] themeVariant = ['relearn-light', 'relearn-dark']\rparams: themeVariant: - relearn-light - relearn-dark\r{ \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": [ \"relearn-light\", \"relearn-dark\" ] } }\rTip\rThe theme provides an advanced configuration mode, combining the functionality for multiple variants with the below possibilities of adjusting to your OS settings and syntax highlightning and even more!\nAlthough all options documented here are still working, the advanced configuration options are the recommended way to configure your color variants. See below.\nAdjust to OS Settings You can also cause the site to adjust to your OS settings for light/dark mode. Just set the themeVariant to auto to become an auto mode variant. That’s it.\nYou can use the auto value with the single or multiple variants option. If you are using multiple variants, you can drop auto at any position in the option’s array, but usually it makes sense to set it in the first position and make it the default.\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[params] themeVariant = ['auto', 'red']\rparams: themeVariant: - auto - red\r{ \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": [ \"auto\", \"red\" ] } }\rIf you don’t configure anything else, the theme will default to use relearn-light for light mode and relearn-dark for dark mode. These defaults are overwritten by the first two non-auto options of your themeVariant option if present.\nIn the above example, you would end with red for light mode and the default of relearn-dark for dark mode.\nIf you don’t like that behavior, you can explicitly set themeVariantAuto. The first entry in the array is the color variant for light mode, the second for dark mode.\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[params] themeVariantAuto = ['learn', 'neon']\rparams: themeVariantAuto: - learn - neon\r{ \"params\": { \"themeVariantAuto\": [ \"learn\", \"neon\" ] } }\rChange the Favicon If your favicon is a SVG, PNG or ICO, just drop your image in your site’s static/images/ directory and name it favicon.svg, favicon.png or favicon.ico respectively.\nIf you want to adjust your favicon according to your OS settings for light/dark mode, add the image files static/images/favicon-light.svg and static/images/favicon-dark.svg to your site’s directory, respectively, corresponding to your file format. In case some of the files are missing, the theme falls back to favicon.svg for each missing file. All supplied favicons must be of the same file format.\nIf no favicon file is found, the theme will lookup the alternative filename logo in the same location and will repeat the search for the list of supported file types.\nIf you need to change this default behavior, create a new file layouts/partials/favicon.html in your site’s directory and write something like this:\n​\rlayouts/partials/favicon.html\r\u003clink rel=\"icon\" href=\"/images/favicon.bmp\" type=\"image/bmp\"\u003e\rChange the Logo Create a new file in layouts/partials/logo.html of your site. Then write any HTML you want. You could use an img HTML tag and reference an image created under the static folder, or you could paste a SVG definition!\nNote\rThe size of the logo will adapt automatically.\nSyntax Highlightning If you want to switch the syntax highlighting theme together with your color variant, you need to configure your installation according to Hugo’s documentation and provide a syntax highlighting stylesheet file.\nYou can use a one of the shipped stylesheet files or use Hugo to generate a file for you. The file must be written to static/css/chroma-\u003cNAME\u003e.css. To use it with your color variant you have to define --CODE-theme: \u003cNAME\u003e in the color variant stylesheet file.\nFor an example, take a look into theme-relearn-light.css and hugo.toml of the exampleSite.\nChange the Variant (Advanced) The theme offers a new way to configure theme variants and all of the aspects above inside of a single configuration item. This comes with some features previously unsupported.\nLike with the multiple variants option, you are defining your theme variants in an array but now not by simple strings but in a table with suboptions.\nAgain, in this case, the first variant is the default chosen on first view and a variant selector will be shown in the menu footer if the array contains more than one entry.\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[params] themeVariant = ['relearn-light', 'relearn-dark']\rparams: themeVariant: - relearn-light - relearn-dark\r{ \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": [ \"relearn-light\", \"relearn-dark\" ] } }\ryou now write it that way:\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[params] [[params.themeVariant]] identifier = 'relearn-light' [[params.themeVariant]] identifier = 'relearn-dark'\rparams: themeVariant: - identifier: relearn-light - identifier: relearn-dark\r{ \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": [ { \"identifier\": \"relearn-light\" }, { \"identifier\": \"relearn-dark\" } ] } }\rThe identifier option is mandatory and equivalent to the string in the first example. Further options can be configured, see the table below.\nParameter Name Default Notes identifier \u003cempty\u003e Must correspond to the name of a color variant either in your site’s or the theme’s directory in the form static/css/theme-\u003cIDENTIFIER\u003e.css. name see notes The name to be displayed in the variant selector. If not set, the identifier is used in a human readable form. auto \u003cempty\u003e If set, the variant is treated as an auto mode variant. It has the same behavior as the themeVariantAuto option. The first entry in the array is the color variant for light mode, the second for dark mode. Defining auto mode variants with the advanced options has the benefit that you can now have multiple auto mode variants instead of just one with the simple options. Example Configuration of This Site hugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[params] [[params.themeVariant]] auto = [] identifier = 'relearn-auto' name = 'Relearn Light/Dark' [[params.themeVariant]] identifier = 'relearn-light' [[params.themeVariant]] identifier = 'relearn-dark' [[params.themeVariant]] auto = ['zen-light', 'zen-dark'] identifier = 'zen-auto' name = 'Zen Light/Dark' [[params.themeVariant]] identifier = 'zen-light' [[params.themeVariant]] identifier = 'zen-dark' [[params.themeVariant]] identifier = 'neon'\rparams: themeVariant: - auto: [] identifier: relearn-auto name: Relearn Light/Dark - identifier: relearn-light - identifier: relearn-dark - auto: - zen-light - zen-dark identifier: zen-auto name: Zen Light/Dark - identifier: zen-light - identifier: zen-dark - identifier: neon\r{ \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": [ { \"auto\": [], \"identifier\": \"relearn-auto\", \"name\": \"Relearn Light/Dark\" }, { \"identifier\": \"relearn-light\" }, { \"identifier\": \"relearn-dark\" }, { \"auto\": [ \"zen-light\", \"zen-dark\" ], \"identifier\": \"zen-auto\", \"name\": \"Zen Light/Dark\" }, { \"identifier\": \"zen-light\" }, { \"identifier\": \"zen-dark\" }, { \"identifier\": \"neon\" } ] } }\rModify Shipped Variants In case you like a shipped variant but only want to tweak some aspects, you have two choices:\nCopy and change\nYou can copy the shipped variant file from the theme’s static/css directory to the site’s static/css directory and either store it with the same name or give it a new name. Edit the settings and save the new file. Afterwards you can use it in your hugo.toml by the choosen name.\nCreate and import\nYou can create a new variant file in the site’s static/css directory and give it a new name. Import the shipped variant, add the settings you want to change and save the new file. Afterwards you can use it in your hugo.toml by the choosen name.\nFor example, you want to use the relearn-light variant but want to change the syntax highlightning schema to the one used in the neon variant. For that, create a new static/css/theme-my-branding.css in your site’s directory and add the following lines:\n​\rstatic/css/theme-my-branding.css\r@import \"theme-relearn-light.css\"; :root { --CODE-theme: neon; /* name of the chroma stylesheet file */ --CODE-BLOCK-color: rgba( 226, 228, 229, 1 ); /* fallback color for code text */ --CODE-BLOCK-BG-color: rgba( 40, 42, 54, 1 ); /* fallback color for code background */ }\rAfterwards put this in your hugo.toml to use your new variant:\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[params] themeVariant = 'my-branding'\rparams: themeVariant: my-branding\r{ \"params\": { \"themeVariant\": \"my-branding\" } }\rIn comparison to copy and change, this has the advantage that you profit from any adjustments to the relearn-light variant but keep your modifications.\n",

    "content": "Usage scenarios The theme is usable in different scenarios, requiring the following mandatory settings in your hugo.toml. All settings not mentioned can be set to your liking.\nPublic Webserver from Root hugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\rbaseURL = 'https://example.com/'\rbaseURL: https://example.com/\r{ \"baseURL\": \"https://example.com/\" }\rPublic Webserver from Subdirectory hugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\rbaseURL = 'https://example.com/mysite/' relativeURLs = false\rbaseURL: https://example.com/mysite/ relativeURLs: false\r{ \"baseURL\": \"https://example.com/mysite/\", \"relativeURLs\": false }\rPrivate Webserver (LAN) The same settings as with any of the public webserver usage scenarios or\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\rbaseURL = '/' relativeURLs = true\rbaseURL: / relativeURLs: true\r{ \"baseURL\": \"/\", \"relativeURLs\": true }\rFile System hugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\rbaseURL = '/' relativeURLs = true\rbaseURL: / relativeURLs: true\r{ \"baseURL\": \"/\", \"relativeURLs\": true }\rWarning\rUsing a baseURL with a subdirectory and relativeURLs=true are mutally exclusive due to the fact, that Hugo does not apply the baseURL correctly.\nIf you need both, you have to generate your site twice but with different settings into separate directories.\nNote\rSublemental pages (like sitemap.xml, rss.xml) and generated social media links inside of your pages will always be generated with absolute URLs and will not work if you set relativeURLs=true.\nInfo\rIf you are using uglyURLs=false (Hugo’s default), the theme will append an additional index.html to all page links to make your site be servable from the file system. If you don’t care about the file system and only serve your page via a webserver you can generate the links without this:\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[params] disableExplicitIndexURLs = true\rparams: disableExplicitIndexURLs: true\r{ \"params\": { \"disableExplicitIndexURLs\": true } }\rActivate search If not already present, add the following lines in your hugo.toml file.\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[outputs] home = ['html', 'rss', 'search']\routputs: home: - html - rss - search\r{ \"outputs\": { \"home\": [ \"html\", \"rss\", \"search\" ] } }\rThis will generate a search index file at the root of your public folder ready to be consumed by the Lunr search library. Note that the search outputformat was named json in previous releases but was implemented differently. Although json still works, it is now deprecated.\nNote\rIf you want to use the search feature from the file system, migrating from an older installation of the theme, make sure to change your outputformat for the homepage from the now deprecated json to search as seen below.\nActivate dedicated search page You can add a dedicated search page for your page by adding the searchpage outputformat to your home page by adding the following lines in your hugo.toml file. This will cause Hugo to generate a new file http://example.com/mysite/search.html.\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[outputs] home = ['html', 'rss', 'search', 'searchpage']\routputs: home: - html - rss - search - searchpage\r{ \"outputs\": { \"home\": [ \"html\", \"rss\", \"search\", \"searchpage\" ] } }\rYou can access this page by either clicking on the magnifier glass or by typing some search term and pressing ENTER inside of the menu’s search box .\nNote\rTo have Hugo create the dedicated search page successfully, you must not generate the URL http://example.com/mysite/search.html from your own content. This can happen if you set uglyURLs=true in your hugo.toml and defining a Markdown file content/search.md.\nTo make sure, there is no duplicate content for any given URL of your project, run hugo --printPathWarnings.\nActivate print support You can activate print support to add the capability to print whole chapters or even the complete site. Just add the print output format to your home, section and page in your hugo.toml as seen below:\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[outputs] home = ['html', 'rss', 'print', 'search'] page = ['html', 'rss', 'print'] section = ['html', 'rss', 'print']\routputs: home: - html - rss - print - search page: - html - rss - print section: - html - rss - print\r{ \"outputs\": { \"home\": [ \"html\", \"rss\", \"print\", \"search\" ], \"page\": [ \"html\", \"rss\", \"print\" ], \"section\": [ \"html\", \"rss\", \"print\" ] } }\rThis will add a little printer icon in the top bar. It will switch the page to print preview when clicked. You can then send this page to the printer by using your browser’s usual print functionality.\nNote\rThe resulting URL will not be configured ugly in terms of Hugo’s URL handling even if you’ve set uglyURLs=true in your hugo.toml. This is due to the fact that for one mime type only one suffix can be configured.\nNevertheless, if you’re unhappy with the resulting URLs you can manually redefine outputFormats.print in your own hugo.toml to your liking.\nHome Button Configuration If the disableLandingPageButton option is set to false, a Home button will appear on the left menu. It is an alternative for clicking on the logo. To edit the appearance, you will have to configure the landingPageName for the defined languages:\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[languages] [languages.en] [languages.en.params] landingPageName = \"\u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Home\" [languages.pir] [languages.pir.params] landingPageName = \"\u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Arrr! Homme\"\rlanguages: en: params: landingPageName: \u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Home pir: params: landingPageName: \u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Arrr! Homme\r{ \"languages\": { \"en\": { \"params\": { \"landingPageName\": \"\\u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\\u003e\\u003c/i\\u003e Home\" } }, \"pir\": { \"params\": { \"landingPageName\": \"\\u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\\u003e\\u003c/i\\u003e Arrr! Homme\" } } } }\rIf this option is not configured for a specific language, they will get their default values:\n​\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\rlandingPageName = \"\u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Home\"\rlandingPageName: \u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Home\r{ \"landingPageName\": \"\\u003ci class='fa-fw fas fa-home'\\u003e\\u003c/i\\u003e Home\" }\rThe home button is going to look like this:\nSocial Media Meta Tags You can add social media meta tags for the Open Graph protocol and Twitter Cards to your site. These are configured as mentioned in the Hugo docs.\nChange the Menu Width The menu width adjusts automatically for different screen sizes.\nName Screen Width Menu Width S \u003c 48rem 14.375rem M 48rem - 60rem 14.375rem L \u003e= 60rem 18.75rem The values for the screen width breakpoints aren’t configurable.\nIf you want to adjust the menu width you can define the following CSS variables in your custom-header.html. Note that --MENU-WIDTH-S applies to the menu flyout width in mobile mode for small screen sizes.\n:root { --MENU-WIDTH-S: 14.375rem; --MENU-WIDTH-M: 14.375rem; --MENU-WIDTH-L: 18.75rem; }Change the Main Area’s Max Width By default the main area width will only grow to a certain extent if more vertical screen space is available. This is done for readability purposes as long line are usually harder to read.\nIf you are unhappy with the default, you can define the following CSS variable in your custom-header.html and set the value to your liking. If you want to use all available space, select a really big value like 1000rem;\n:root { --MAIN-WIDTH-MAX: 80.25rem; }Own Shortcodes with JavaScript Dependencies Certain shortcodes make use of additional JavaScript files. The theme only loads these dependencies if the shortcode is used. To do so correctly the theme adds management code in various files.\nYou can you use this mechanism in your own shortcodes. Say you want to add a shortcode myshortcode that also requires the jquery JavaScript library.\nWrite the shortcode file layouts/shortcodes/myshortcode.html and add the following line\n{{- .Page.Store.Set \"hasMyShortcode\" true }} Add the following snippet to your hugo.toml\nhugo.\rtoml\ryaml\rjson\r[params] [params.relearn] [params.relearn.dependencies] [params.relearn.dependencies.myshortcode] location = 'footer' name = 'MyShortcode'\rparams: relearn: dependencies: myshortcode: location: footer name: MyShortcode\r{ \"params\": { \"relearn\": { \"dependencies\": { \"myshortcode\": { \"location\": \"footer\", \"name\": \"MyShortcode\" } } } } }\rAdd the dependency loader file layouts/partials/dependencies/myshortcode.html. The loader file will be appended to your header or footer, dependend on the location setting in your hugo.toml.\n\u003cscript src=\"https://www.unpkg.com/jquery/dist/jquery.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e Character casing is relevant!\nthe name setting in your hugo.toml must match the key (that needs to be prefixed with a has) you used for the store in your layouts/shortcodes/myshortcode.html. the key on params.relearn.dependencies in your hugo.toml must match the base file name of your loader file. See the math, mermaid and openapi shortcodes for examples.\nOutput Formats Certain parts of the theme can be changed for support of your own output formats. Eg. if you define a new output format PLAINTEXT in your hugo.toml, you can add a file layouts/partials/header.plaintext.html to change the way, the page header should look like for that output format.\nReact to Variant Switches in JavaScript Once a color variant is fully loaded, either initially or by switching the color variant manually with the variant selector, the custom event themeVariantLoaded on the document will be dispatched. You can add an event listener and react to changes.\ndocument.addEventListener( 'themeVariantLoaded', function( e ){ console.log( e.detail.variant ); // `relearn-light` });Partials The Relearn theme has been built to be as configurable as possible by defining multiple partials\nIn themes/hugo-theme-relearn/layouts/partials/, you will find all the partials defined for this theme. If you need to overwrite something, don’t change the code directly. Instead follow this page. You’d create a new partial in the layouts/partials folder of your local project. This partial will have the priority.\nThis theme defines the following partials :\nheader.html: the header of the page. See output-formats footer.html: the footer of the page.

You can click on any of the colored boxes to adjust the respective color. The graph and the page will update accordingly.\nThe arrowed lines reflect how colors are inherited thru different parts of the theme if the descendent isn’t overwritten. If you want to delete a color and let it inherit from its parent, just delete the value from the input field.\nTo better understand this select the neon variant and modify the different heading colors. There, colors for the heading h2, h3 and h4 are explicitly set. h5 is not set and inherits its value from h4. h6 is also not set and inherits its value from h5.\nOnce you’ve changed a color, the variant selector will show a “My custom variant” entry and your changes are stored in the browser. You can browse to other pages and even close the browser without losing your changes.\nOnce you are satisfied, you can download the new variants file and copy it into your site’s static/css directory. Afterwards you have to adjust the themeVariant parameter in your hugo.toml to your chosen file name.\nEg. if your new variants file is named theme-my-custom-variant.css, you have to set themeVariant='my-custom-variant' to use it.\nDownload variant Reset variant\nGraph\rDownload variant Reset variant\n",

    "content": "The theme comes with a reasonably configured topbar.\nNevertheless, your requirements may differ from this configuration. Luckily the theme got you covered as the themebar, its buttons and the functionality behind these buttons is fully configurable by you.\nTip\rAll mentioned file names below can be clicked and show you the implementation for a better understanding.\nAreas The default configuration comes with three predefined areas that may contain an arbitrary set of buttons.\nstart: shown between menu and breadcrumb end: shown on the opposite breadcrumb side in comparison to the start area more: shown when pressing the more button in the topbar While you can not add additional areas in the topbar, you are free to configure addtional buttons that behave like the more button, providing further user defined areas.\nButtons The theme ships with the following predefined buttons (from left to right in the screenshot)\nsidebar: opens the sidebar flyout if in mobile layout toc: opens the table of contents in an overlay edit: browses to the editable page if the editURL parameter is set print: browses to the chapters printable page if print support was activated prev: browses to the previous page if there is one next: browses to the next page if there is one more: opens the overlay for the more area Not all buttons are displayed at every given time. This is configurable (see below if interested).\nRedefining Areas Each predefined area and button comes in their own file. By that it is easy for you to overwrite an area file in your installation reusing only the buttons you like.\nEg. you can redefine the predefined end area by adding the file layouts/partials/topbar/area/end.html in your installation (not in the theme itself) to remove all but the more button.\nThe below example sets an explicit value for the onempty parameter, overriding the specific default value for this button (these defaults vary depending on the button). The parameter causes the more button to always be displayed instead of hiding once its content is empty.\n{{ partial \"topbar/button/more.html\" (dict \"page\" . \"onempty\" \"disable\" )}}Defining own Buttons Button Types The theme distingushies between two types of buttons:\nbutton: a clickable button that either browses to another site, triggers a user defined script or opens an overlay containing user defined content area-button: the template for the more button, to define your own area overlay buttons Button Parameter Screen Widths and Actions Depending on the screen width you can configure how the button should behave. Screen width is divided into three classes:\ns: (controlled by the onwidths parameter) mobile layout where the menu sidebar is hidden m: (controlled by the onwidthm parameter) desktop layout with visible sidebar while the content area width still resizes l: (controlled by the onwidthl parameter) desktop layout with visible sidebar once the content area reached its maximum width For each width class, you can configure one of the following actions:\nshow: the button is displayed in its given area hide: the button is removed area-XXX: the button is moved from its given area into the area XXX; eg. this is used to move buttons to the more area overlay in the mobile layout Hiding and Disabling Stuff While hiding a button dependend on the screen size can be configured with the above described hide action, you may want to hide the button on certain other conditions aswell.\nFor example, the print button in its default configuration should only be displayed if print support was configured. This is done in your button template by checking the conditions first before displaying the button (see layouts/partials/topbar/button/print.html).\nAnother prefered condition for hiding a button is, if the displayed overlay is empty. This is the case for the toc (see layouts/partials/topbar/button/toc.html) aswell as the more button (see layouts/partials/topbar/button/more.html) and controlled by the parameter onempty.\nThis parameter can have one of the following values:\ndisable: the button displayed in disabled state if the overlay is empty hide: the button is removed if the overlay is empty If you want to disable a button containing no overlay, this can be achieved by an empty href parameter. An example can be seen in the prev button (see layouts/partials/topbar/button/prev.html) where the URL for the previous site may be empty.\nReference Button Contains the basic button functionality and is used as a base implementation for all other buttons (layouts/partials/topbar/func/button.html).\nCall this from your own button templates if you want to implement a button without an overlay like the print button (layouts/partials/topbar/button/print.html) or with an overlay containing arbitrary content like the toc button (layouts/partials/topbar/button/toc.html).\nFor displaying an area in the button’s overlay, see Area-Button.\nParameter Name Default Notes page \u003cempty\u003e Mandatory reference to the page. class \u003cempty\u003e Mandatory unique class name for this button. Displaying two buttons with the same value for class is undefined. href \u003cempty\u003e Either the destination URL for the button or JavaScript code to be executed on click.\n- if starting with javascript: all following text will be executed in your browser\n- every other string will be interpreted as URL\n- if empty the button will be displayed in disabled state regardless of its content icon \u003cempty\u003e Font Awesome icon name. onempty disable Defines what to do with the button if the content parameter was set but ends up empty:\n- disable: The button is displayed in disabled state.\n- hide: The button is removed. onwidths show The action, that should be executed if the site is displayed in the given width:\n- show: The button is displayed in its given area\n- hide: The button is removed.\n- area-XXX: The button is moved from its given area into the area XXX. onwidthm show See above. onwidthl show See above. hint \u003cempty\u003e Arbitrary text displayed in the tooltip. title \u003cempty\u003e Arbitrary text for the button. content \u003cempty\u003e Arbitrary HTML to put into the content overlay. This parameter may be empty. In this case no overlay will be generated. Area-Button Contains the basic functionality to display area overlay buttons (layouts/partials/topbar/func/area-button.html).\nCall this from your own button templates if you want to implement a button with an area overlay like the more button (layouts/partials/topbar/button/more.html).\nParameter Name Default Notes page \u003cempty\u003e Mandatory reference to the page. area \u003cempty\u003e Mandatory unique area name for this area.

Predefined Buttons The predefined buttons by the theme (all other buttons besides the more and toc button in layouts/partials/topbar/button).\nCall these from your own redefined area templates if you want to use default button behavior.\nThe \u003cvarying\u003e parameter values are different for each button and configured for standard behavior as seen on this page.\nParameter Name Default Notes page \u003cempty\u003e Mandatory reference to the page. onwidths \u003cvarying\u003e The action, that should be executed if the site is displayed in the given width:\n- show: The button is displayed in its given area\n- hide: The button is removed.\n- area-XXX: The button is moved from its given area into the area XXX. onwidthm \u003cvarying\u003e See above. onwidthl \u003cvarying\u003e See above. Predefined Overlay-Buttons The predefined buttons by the theme that open an overlay (the more and toc button in layouts/partials/topbar/button).\nCall these from your own redefined area templates if you want to use default button behavior utilizing overlay functionality.\nThe \u003cvarying\u003e parameter values are different for each button and configured for standard behavior as seen on this page.\nParameter Name Default Notes page \u003cempty\u003e Mandatory reference to the page. onempty disable Defines what to do with the button if the content overlay is empty:\n- disable: The button is displayed in disabled state.\n- hide: The button is removed. onwidths \u003cvarying\u003e The action, that should be executed if the site is displayed in the given width:\n- show: The button is displayed in its given area\n- hide: The button is removed.\n- area-XXX: The button is moved from its given area into the area XXX. onwidthm \u003cvarying\u003e See above. onwidthl \u003cvarying\u003e See above.

    "content": "Can, Could, và Be able to đều mang nghĩa “có thể”, diễn tả khả năng làm gì. Tuy nhiên, chúng vẫn có những sự khác nhau nhất định.\n1. Can\nCan được dùng để diễn đạt:\na. Khả năng ở hiện tại hoặc tương lai\nEg: I haven’t got time today, but I can see you tomorrow.\n(Hôm nay tôi không có thời gian, nhưng tôi có thể gặp bạn vào ngày mai.)\nb. Sự xin phép và cho phép, và thể phủ định (cannot) chỉ sự cấm đoán trong văn nói\nEg: Can I use your phone? (Tôi có thể dùng điện thoại của bạn không?)\nc. Yêu cầu, đề nghị hoặc gợi ý\nEg: Can you wait a moment, please? (Vui lòng đợi một lát nhé?)\nd. Khi dùng với động từ tri giác thì nó mang nghĩa tiếp diễn\nEg: Listen! I think someone is singing = Listen! I think I can hear someone singing.\n(Nghe này! Tôi nghĩ có ai đó đang hát.)\n2. Could\na. Could là dạng quá khứ của Can, chỉ khả năng ở quá khứ\nEg: My sister could play the piano when she was 4.\n(Em gái tôi biết chơi dương cầm từ khi 4 tuổi.)\nb. Could là trợ động từ tình thái, dùng để diễn đạt:\n- Điều có thể xảy ra ở hiện tại hoặc tương lai nhưng không chắc chắn\nEg: The phone is ringing. It could be Tom.\n(Điện thoại đang kêu kìa, có thể là Tom đấy.)\n- Sự xin phép (trịnh trọng hơn dùng Can)\nEg: Could I ask you something? (Tôi có thể hỏi bạn vài đều không?)\n- Yêu cầu lịch sự, trịnh trọng hơn Can\nEg: Could you mail this letter for me? (Bạn có thể chuyển bức thứ này giúp tôi không?)\nc. Could được dùng trong câu điều kiện loại II\nEg: If you tried, you could do that work. (Nếu bạn cố gắng, tôi đã có thể làm công việc đó.)\n3. Be able to\n- Am/ is/ are + able to = Can (chỉ khả năng)\n- Was/ were + able to = Could (chỉ khả năng)\nLưu ý: Nếu câu nói hàm ý một sự thành công trong việc thực hiện hành động mà chủ thể đã cố gắng, xoay sở để thực hiện thì Be able to được sử dụng chứ không phải Could.\nEg: The plane was able to take off after the fog had lifted.\n(Máy bay đã có thể cất cánh sau khi sương mù tan.)\n",

Lưu ý rằng Google Analytics chỉ có sẵn cho khách truy cập từ miền tùy chỉnh của bạn.\nKhi kiểm tra Google Analytics, hãy đảm bảo tắt mọi tiện ích extension trình duyệt chặn quảng cáo như uBlock Origin, tiện ích này chặn chạy các tập lệnh Google Analytics.\nNgoài ra, Obsidian Publish hiện không tương thích trực tiếp với Google Tag Manager - bạn có thể thiết lập nó bằng cách sử dụng javascript tùy chỉnh nếu bạn muốn sử dụng Google Tag Manager thay vì Google Analytics.\nTùy chỉnh domain Bạn có thể thiết lập tùy chỉnh domain hoặc subdomain cho trang web Obsidian Publish. Hiện tại, chúng tôi chưa có cách nào để cung cấp chứng chỉ SSL thay mặt bạn, vì vậy bạn cần sử dụng máy chủ hỗ trợ SSL của riêng bạn hoặc thiết lập trang web của bạn trên CloudFlare, nơi cung cấp SSL miễn phí.\nBạn cũng có thể thiết lập Obsidian Publish làm sub-URL của trang web mà bạn sở hữu. Ví dụ: https://mysite.com/my-notes/. Để đạt được điều này, bạn phải lưu trữ máy chủ của riêng mình và proxy tất cả các yêu cầu đến máy chủ của chúng tôi tại https://publish.obsidian.md/.\nTiếp tục đọc để biết chi tiết thiết lập.\nThiết lập CloudFlare Cách dễ nhất để thiết lập tùy chỉnh domain hoặc subdomain là tạo tài khoản với CloudFlare và cho phép CloudFlare quản lý domain của bạn. Điều này cho phép bạn thêm SSL miễn phí vào trang web của mình cũng như đảm bảo trang web của bạn hoạt động nhanh chóng ở bất kỳ đâu trên thế giới mà nó được truy cập từ đó. Thông thường, người dùng sẽ lưu trữ nội dung Obsidian Publish của họ trên một domain gốc (ví dụ: mysite.com) hoặc một subdomain (ví dụ: notes.mysite.com). Hướng dẫn sau đây hoạt động tốt trong cả hai trường hợp.\nMở Cloudflare vào domain bạn muốn thêm Publish vào (ví dụ: mysite.com, ngay cả khi bạn muốn một subdomain như notes.mysite.com). Chuyển đến DNS và nhấn vào Add Record. Chọn CNAME và trong ’name’ nhập domain hoặc subdomain bạn muốn (ví dụ: notes.mysite.com). Trong ’target’, nhập publish-main.obsidian.md. Không bao gồm sub-URL cá nhân của bạn trong dữ liệu này, vì Obsidian Publish xử lý điều này từ cấu hình của bạn. Đi tới SSL/TLS và đặt chế độ mã hóa SSL/TLS thành Full. Điều này sẽ tự động định cấu hình chứng chỉ SSL/TLS. Khi bạn đã hoàn tất việc định cấu hình CloudFlare, bạn có thể đi đến các tùy chọn trang web của mình trong Obsidian và đặt URL cho domain hoặc subdomain của bạn. Điều này cho phép máy chủ của chúng tôi liên kết domain với trang web của bạn.\nKhắc phục sự cố: Nếu thiết lập tùy chỉnh domain của bạn kết thúc trong một vòng lặp chuyển hướng, có thể chế độ mã hóa trong CloudFlare thành Flexible thay vì Full.\nNếu bạn muốn định cấu hình cả mysite.com và www.mysite.com cho Obsidian Publish, bạn sẽ cần tạo Quy tắc trang như sau:\nURL match: www.mysite.com/* Foward URL - 301 Permanent Redirect Redirect URL: https://mysite.com/$1 Khi bạn tạo quy tắc trang, bạn cũng nên tạo record CNAME cho www.mysite.com giống như bạn đã tạo cho mysite.com\nThiết lập Proxy/chuyển hướng Nếu bạn muốn lưu trữ máy chủ web của riêng mình và thiết lập mã hóa SSL của riêng mình, bạn có thể chọn tùy chọn này. Nếu bạn đã lưu trữ một trang web trong domain hoặc subdomain của mình, bạn cũng có thể sử dụng tùy chọn này và thiết lập trang web của mình để tải trang web Obsidian Publish của bạn theo một đường dẫn URL cụ thể, thay vì lưu trữ toàn bộ trang web.\nChỉ cần ủy quyền cho tất cả các yêu cầu theo đường dẫn URL đó đến https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/... và định cấu hình các tùy chọn trang web trong Obsidian theo cùng một đường dẫn URL bằng cách đặt Tùy chỉnh URL thành mysite.com/my-notes.\nNGINX location /my-notes { proxy_pass https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/; proxy_ssl_server_name on; }Apache Thêm vào .htaccess:\nRewriteEngine on RewriteRule \"^my-notes/(.*)$\" \"https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/$1\" [L,P]Lưu ý: mod_rewrite phải được bật và bạn cũng có thể cần định cấu hình SSLProxyEngine\nNetlify [[redirects]]\rfrom = \"https://mysite.com/my-notes/*\"\rto = \"https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/:splat\"\rstatus = 200\rforce = trueVercel { ... \"rewrites\": [ { \"source\": \"/my-notes/\", \"destination\": \"https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes\" }, { \"source\": \"/my-notes/:path*\", \"destination\": \"https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/:path*\" } ] }HTTP X-Headers được hỗ trợ Ngoài ra, nếu dịch vụ proxy của bạn không cho phép đường dẫn truy vấn, bạn có thể sử dụng https://publish.obsidian.md/ với tiêu đề tùy chỉnh x-obsidian-custom-domain được đặt thành url trang web của bạn mysite.com/my-subpath.\nSự cố sau thiết lập domain tùy chỉnh Khi bạn thiết lập domain tùy chỉnh, nếu bạn đã truy cập trang web của mình từ liên kết https://publish.obsidian.md/slug trước đó, bạn phải xóa bộ nhớ cache của trình duyệt cho một số thứ nhất định (như font, đồ họa hoặc truy cập mật khẩu) để hoạt động bình thường. Điều này là do các hạn chế bảo mật cross-domain được áp dụng bởi các trình duyệt hiện đại. Tin tốt là người đọc trang web của bạn sẽ không bao giờ gặp vấn đề này nếu bạn chỉ cho phép khách truy cập sử dụng domain tùy chỉnh của mình.\nChuyển hướng trang web cũ sang domain tùy chỉnh Nếu bạn muốn chuyển hướng khách truy cập của mình từ trang web cũ publish.obsidian.md sang tên domain tùy chỉnh mới của mình, bạn có thể chọn bật tính năng này từ trang cài đặt domain tùy chỉnh của mình.\nSắp có Obsidian Publish vẫn đang trong giai đoạn phát triển ban đầu. Chúng tôi hiện đang có kế hoạch bổ sung các tính năng sau:\nHỗ trợ đầy đủ cho các domain tùy chỉnh (cung cấp chứng chỉ SSL). Tìm kiếm toàn văn bản. Nhiều chủ đề tích hợp sẵn hơn. Vui lòng cho chúng tôi biết nếu bạn có bất kỳ yêu cầu nào về tính năng Obsidian Publish bằng cách gửi yêu cầu trên forum tại đây.\nPricing Để biết giá của Obsidian Publish, vui lòng truy cập trang Pricing.\nChi tiết kỹ thuật Obsidian Publish sử dụng Cloudflare làm CDN (mạng lưới phân phối nội dung) để phân phối trang web của bạn trên toàn cầu nhằm truy cập nhanh hơn. Điều này liên quan đến việc lưu vào bộ nhớ đệm các bản sao của các tệp trên trang web của bạn trên một số trong số hơn 200 trung tâm dữ liệu để đảm bảo độ trễ thấp nhất cho người đọc của bạn và trang web vẫn chạy nhanh và tải nhanh ngay cả khi người xem của bạn ở xa các máy chủ chính của chúng tôi.\nTuy nhiên, điều này có nghĩa là khi bạn thay đổi cài đặt trang web, xuất bản nội dung mới hoặc hủy xuất bản nội dung, khách truy cập có thể không thấy phiên bản mới nhất trong một thời gian ngắn. Hiện tại, bộ nhớ cache của chúng tôi được định cấu hình để tồn tại trong một giờ trước khi nó phải được “xác thực lại” để đảm bảo nội dung không thay đổi.\nNếu bạn vừa xuất bản các mục nhưng vẫn thấy phiên bản cũ hơn, bạn thường có thể thực hiện “làm mới” bằng cách giữ nút tải lại và chọn “Hard reload” trong menu thả xuống. Nếu không, bạn có thể thử xóa bộ nhớ cache của trình duyệt hoặc tắt bộ nhớ cache bằng các công cụ dành cho nhà lập trình trong tab mạng.\nLưu trữ các file phương tiện Mặc dù Obsidian Publish cho phép bạn tải lên các video clip, nhưng nó không được tối ưu hóa để phân phối video. Do đó, khách truy cập của bạn có thể thấy rằng các video trên trang web của bạn có thể không mang lại trải nghiệm tuyệt vời.\nChúng tôi khuyên bạn nên sử dụng dịch vụ lưu trữ video thích hợp như YouTube hoặc Vimeo để lưu trữ video của bạn cho Obsidian Publish. Những lợi thế của việc sử dụng một trang web lưu trữ video thích hợp bao gồm:\nMã hóa lại tự động đảm bảo rằng video của bạn có thể được phát trên tất cả các thiết bị di động bất kể bạn đã sử dụng định dạng mã hóa nào trong tệp gốc của mình. Điều chỉnh chất lượng động dựa trên tính khả dụng của băng thông và đảm bảo rằng video có thể được phát mượt mà mà không liên tục tạm dừng để “lưu vào bộ đệm”. Nén video hiệu quả cao để đảm bảo rằng khách truy cập không vượt qua giới hạn dữ liệu của họ khi xem trang web của bạn. CDN toàn cầu cho phép tải video của bạn nhanh chóng bất kể khách truy cập của bạn ở đâu trên thế giới. Liên quan Tham khảo Publish plugin để biết chi tiết về cách xuất bản ghi chú của bạn.\n",

Đối với bất kỳ ghi chú nào bạn chọn không publish, bạn có thể tin tưởng rằng những ghi chú đó vẫn hoàn toàn privacy và Obsidian Publish không hề biết về chúng.\nSao lưu Lưu ý rằng Obsidian Publish không thể sử dụng làm bản sao lưu cho nội dung của bạn. Đảm bảo rằng bạn luôn có một bản sao lưu trang web của mình bằng cách sử dụng bất kỳ phương pháp sao lưu ưa thích của bạn. Obsidian Publish sẽ tập trung hơn vào chức năng, tính dễ sử dụng và tính khả dụng của trang web.\nDemo Có thể bạn đã xem bài viết này trên trang web chính thức của chúng tôi do Obsidian Publish cung cấp.\nNhững gì được bao gồm trong dịch vụ Dịch vụ Obsidian Publish cho phép bạn tạo trang web của mình trực tiếp từ bên trong ứng dụng Obsidian bằng cách chọn những ghi chú bạn muốn publish.\nĐể tùy chỉnh trang web của mình, bạn có thể chọn giữa chế độ sáng và tối, đồng thời chuyển đổi giữa độ dài dòng có thể đọc được và độ dài toàn trang.\nCó một số thành phần có thể được bật hoặc tắt từ Publish plugin. Các thay đổi đối với các tùy chọn này sẽ được phản ánh trên trang web đã xuất bản của bạn sau khi bộ nhớ cache xóa, thường trong vòng 5 phút.\nĐiều hướng Bật tùy chọn này sẽ thêm một thanh bên điều hướng hiển thị tất cả các trang đã publish và các thư mục chứa chúng. Người xem sẽ thấy ghi chú đang mở hiện tại được đánh dấu và có thể nhấn vào bất kỳ ghi chú nào khác để điều hướng.\nThanh tìm kiếm Thêm thanh tìm kiếm vào trang. Thanh này có thể được sử dụng để tìm kiếm các trang, alias và tiêu đề trong các trang. Nó hiện không tìm kiếm thông qua toàn bộ nội dung của trang web.\nChế độ xem đồ họa Hiển thị biểu đồ cục bộ của trang hiện đang mở. Nó sử dụng công cụ kết xuất tương tự như plugin Graph View trong Obsidian.\nMục lục Hiển thị mục lục cho trang hiện đang mở. Danh sách được tạo từ các tiêu đề trong trang, tương tự như plugin Outline. Người xem điều hướng ghi chú sẽ thấy tiêu đề tương ứng được đánh dấu khi họ cuộn và có thể nhấn vào tiêu đề khác để chuyển đến chúng ngay lập tức.\nLiên kết ngược Ở cuối mỗi trang, hiển thị phần “Linked to this page” chứa các liên kết ngược từ các trang khác. Nếu không có liên kết ngược, phần này sẽ không được hiển thị.\nTag Khi người đọc nhấp vào một tag, họ có thể thấy danh sách các trang khác có cùng một tag.\nXem trước hover Khi di chuột qua các liên kết, nội dung của chúng được hiển thị trong hộp popup. Điều này hoạt động tương tự như plugin Trang xem trước trong Obsidian.\nTùy chỉnh CSS Để tùy chỉnh style trang web của bạn, bạn có thể tải lên một publish.css. File này phải được lưu trữ trong thư mục gốc của trang web của bạn. Bạn có thể sử dụng chủ đề hiện có của mình và thêm một số chỉnh sửa bổ sung để xuất bản trong publish.css.\nFavicon Để thay đổi biểu tượng yêu thích của trang web của bạn, bạn có thể tải lên các biểu tượng png với bất kỳ kích thước nào ở định dạng favicon-32.png hoặc favicon-32x32.png. Bạn cũng có thể tải lên file favicon.ico. Các file này được lưu trữ trong bất kỳ thư mục nào. Các kích thước được đề xuất hiện tại (kể từ năm 2020) là 32×32, 128x128, 152×152, 167x167, 180x180, 192x192 và 196x196.\nTùy chỉnh JS Nếu bạn muốn thực thi code JavaScript của riêng mình để thay đổi trải nghiệm truy cập hoặc thêm các tích hợp khác nhau như Discus!, Discourse, v.v…, bạn có thể thực hiện việc này bằng cách tải lên publish.js bên trong thư mục gốc của vault. Lưu ý rằng các tập lệnh này sẽ chỉ chạy cho khách truy cập vào miền tùy chỉnh của bạn.\nVô hiệu hóa lập chỉ mục của công cụ tìm kiếm Tùy chọn này sẽ thêm thẻ meta ngăn lập chỉ mục vào tất cả các trang của bạn để các công cụ tìm kiếm như Google không lập chỉ mục trang web của bạn. Lưu ý rằng các công cụ tìm kiếm sẽ không thể lập chỉ mục trang web của bạn nếu nó được bảo vệ bằng mật khẩu.\nGoogle Analytics Nếu bạn muốn thiết lập Google Analytics cho trang web của mình, trước tiên hãy đảm bảo rằng luật và quy định địa phương của bạn cho phép.

Ngay cả với người không biết lập trình cũng có thể dễ dàng tạo cho mình 1 trang web bằng WordPress. Chỉ cần bạn tìm được hướng dẫn chi tiết, dễ hiểu dạng step by step là làm được thôi!\nMình dám khẳng định như vậy là bởi, chính mình cách đây 8 năm về trước mình cũng không biết gì về lập trình web. Nhưng sau khi tự tìm hiểu thì mình cũng đã biết cách tạo trang web cho riêng mình. Mặc dù khi đó, có rất ít hướng dẫn tạo website bằng WordPress.\nHiện tại, bạn có thể dễ dàng lên Google tìm kiếm với từ khóa “cách tạo website bằng WordPress” sẽ thấy một loạt bài viết hướng dẫn. Trong đó có cả bài viết mà bạn đang đọc này!\nTuy nhiên, bài viết này của mình viết ra là để hướng dẫn cách tạo website WordPress cho người không biết lập trình (thiếu kiến thức IT). Nên mình sẽ hướng dẫn chi tiết từng bước để bạn hiểu được cách tạo trang web rồi sau đó bắt tay vào việc viết blog kiếm tiền.\nNếu bạn đã sẵn sàng, chúng ta cùng bắt đầu học làm website bằng WordPress nhé!\nChú ý: Bài viết khá dài nên bạn cần chuẩn bị thời gian dư giả để đọc và làm theo các bước nhé!\nTại sao bạn nên biết tự làm web cho mình? Không chỉ riêng làm web mà bất kể việc gì, nếu bạn là người chủ động làm thì bạn sẽ dễ dàng quản lý nó hơn. Việc bạn tự làm web thứ nhất là bạn sẽ nắm rõ được web của bạn có những gì, thứ hai là khi xảy ra lỗi bạn có thể tự mình sửa được.\nGiả sử nếu bạn đi thuê bên khác làm web thì khi xảy ra lỗi hoặc bạn muốn thêm chức năng gì đó cho web bạn sẽ phải liên hệ với người ta. Mà thực tế cho thấy không phải bên nào họ cũng sẵn sàng sửa ngay khi bạn báo mà kiểu gì cũng bị delay 1 thời gian như vậy sẽ ảnh hưởng đến việc kinh doanh của bạn.\nĐặc biệt, nếu bạn đang muốn làm web để kiếm tiền online thì việc làm web là kỹ năng “cần phải có“. Ví dụ nếu bạn làm affiliate marketing, bạn sẽ cần làm nhiều site ngách, nhiều dự án riêng mà mỗi dự án cần 1 web, việc bạn tự làm web được sẽ tiết kiệm chi phí rất nhiều. Hơn thế, khi bạn biết làm web bạn có thể tối ưu được cho chiến dịch kiếm tiền hiệu quả hơn.\nNgoài ra, khi bạn đi thuê làm web đồng nghĩa với việc bạn đang đưa “miếng cơm” của bạn cho người khác giữ. Nếu sau này web của bạn phát triển, chẳng may gặp phải người nào chơi xấu thì 1 là họ sẽ hất đổ miếng cơm của bạn, 2 là họ sẽ chiếm lấy miếng cơm của bạn.\nChốt lại! Muốn kiếm tiền trên mạng hiệu quả thì bạn cần phải biết làm web để có thể tận dụng được tối đa sức mạnh của web.\nOK. Dài dòng vậy đủ rồi. Chúng ta chuyển sang phần tiếp nha.\nChi phí làm 1 trang web WordPress khoảng bao nhiêu? Bạn đừng sợ rằng làm 1 trang web sẽ tốn nhiều tiền. Bạn tạo trang web theo hướng dẫn của mình thì chi phí sẽ không đáng là bao nhiêu đâu.\nDưới đây mình sẽ chỉ cho bạn các khoản phải chi khi làm 1 trang web bằng WordPress để bạn thấy nó không hề tốn kém nhiều.\nĐầu tiên, bạn cần biết 1 trang web sẽ bao gồm những thứ cơ bản với chi phí như sau:\nTên miền: Khoảng 190K – 800K/năm. Tên miền .com thường rẻ hơn .vn rất nhiều. Hosting: Khoảng từ 500K – vài triệu/năm nhưng khởi đầu thì chỉ cần 500K/năm là đủ. Source code web: Ở đây chúng ta làm web bằng WordPress nên sẽ là miễn phí. Sau này bạn muốn làm giao diện chuyên nghiệp hơn thì có thể trả phí khoảng 50$ – 200$ gì đó tùy bạn. Nhưng bắt đầu cứ từ 0đ trước đã. Để tạo trang web hoạt động được trên internet chúng ta chỉ cần 3 thành phần là tên miền + hosting + source web như trên là đủ.\nNhư vậy, để bắt đầu tạo 1 trang web thì bạn chỉ mất khoảng 700K/năm thôi. Để thoải mái thì bạn cứ chuẩn bị cho mình ngân sách khoảng 1 triệu đồng.\nĐến đây, bạn đã chuẩn bị đủ tiền và đã có đủ quyết tâm tạo để tạo trang web kiếm tiền chưa? Nếu rồi thì chúng ta bắt đầu nha!\nHướng dẫn cách tạo website bằng WordPress từ A – Z Bước 1: Mua tên miền và hosting Với tên miền, bạn nên chọn tên miền dễ nhớ, ngắn gọn và gần với chủ đề trang web bạn chuẩn bị làm.\nVề vấn đề chọn tên miền thì bạn tự tìm và chọn tên miền phù hợp nhé. Sau khi chọn được thì bạn kiểm tra xem đã có ai mua chưa. Nếu chưa ai mua thì bạn nên đăng ký mua luôn.\nViệc kiểm tra và mua tên miền, mình đã có bài hướng dẫn mua tên miền trên Namecheap rồi. Bạn đọc và làm theo nha, mình không viết lại ở đây kẻo làm bài viết dài quá.\nTương tự, với hosting mình cũng đã có bài viết hướng dẫn mua hosting AZDIGI với chất lượng tốt, giá hợp lý. Bạn đọc và làm theo từng bước là mua được dễ dàng thôi.\nSau khi đã mua tên miền và hosting xong thì nhớ thực hiện việc kết nối tên miền và hosting với nhau để chúng hoạt động nhé.\nỞ bài viết này, mình muốn tập trung hướng dẫn cách tạo trang web bằng WordPress nên mình sẽ viết chi tiết hơn ở phần nội dung phía dưới.\nBước 2: Các bước tạo trang web bằng WordPress Trước hết nói nhanh 1 chút về lý do tại sao chúng ta lại tạo trang web bằng WordPress (chú ý là ở đây dùng WordPress.org chứ không phải nền tảng WordPress.com nha).\nHiện tại WordPress là mã nguồn mở miễn phí được sử dụng nhiều nhất thế giới (theo thống kê của W3Techs). Cũng bởi, WordPress sử dụng dễ, hỗ trợ SEO tốt và có cộng đồng người dùng rất đông.\nĐiểm ăn tiền của WordPress là có kho plugin, theme rất đa dạng từ miễn phí đến trả phí. Bạn muốn chức năng gì gần như đều có plugin hỗ trợ, giống như kho app trên điện thoại Android hay iPhone vậy.\nNói tóm lược 1 chút về WordPress như vậy thôi. Bây giờ chúng ta cùng đi đến các bước cài đặt WordPress trên hosting nha.\nNhiều trang hướng dẫn cách cài WordPress tự động thông qua công cụ cài nhanh WordPress cung cấp bởi Softaculous có trên cPanel. Điều đó khiến bạn “làm như 1 con vẹt”! Còn ở đây, mình sẽ hướng dẫn theo cách thủ công để bạn hiểu được cấu trúc thư mục WordPress, database và các bước cài WordPress cơ bản như nào.\n1. Tải mã nguồn WordPress mới nhất\nBạn vào website WordPress.org sau đây để tải bản mới nhất về máy tính: https://wordpress.org/latest.zip\n2. Đăng nhập vào hosting và upload mã nguồn WordPress lên\nBạn mở email chứa thông tin tài khoản hosting mà nhà cung cấp gửi cho bạn sau khi bạn hoàn thành việc mua hosting.\nTrong email đó bạn sẽ thấy 3 thông tin bao gồm: tên đăng nhập, mật khẩu và đường dẫn đăng nhập vào cPanel.\nVí dụ như mình mua hosting AZDIGI và họ gửi cho mình email chứa thông tin như sau:\nClick vào link trên và đăng nhập với các thông tin được cung cấp.\nSau khi đăng nhập xong, tại giao diện trang quản trị cPanel bạn tìm tới mục File Manager và click vào đó để mở trang quản lý file trên hosting.\nTrên trang cPanel File Manager, bạn chọn vào thư mục public_html và xóa hết các file, folder trong đó (nếu có). Sau đó chọn vào Upload để tải lên mã nguồn WordPress.\nGiao diện trang upload hiện ra như sau. Bạn kéo thả hoặc click vào Select file để tìm file trên máy tính.\nBạn tìm file mã nguồn WordPress mà nãy vừa download về máy tính và chọn nó xong ấn Open để upload WordPress lên hosting.\nBạn chờ chút khi nào thấy thông báo upload thành công 100% như hình dưới thì ấn vào Go Back to “/home/…/public_html” để quay về trang quản lý file.\nBây giờ, tiến hành giải nén file .zip trên hosting bằng cách click chuột phải vào file rồi chọn Extract hoặc chọn file rồi ấn vào công cụ Extract ở trên thanh công cụ.\nSẽ có 1 popup hiện lên để bạn nhập đường dẫn thư mục mà bạn muốn giải nén file đến. Bạn cứ để mặc định vậy và ấn Extract files.\nSau khi giải nén xong bạn sẽ thấy trong public_html có các thư mục vào file như sau.\nBạn click đúp chuột vào folder wordpress để mở thư mục đó ra. Sau đó bạn click Select All để chọn tất cả các files, thư mục. Tiếp theo, bạn ấn vào Move để di chuyển tất cả các file, thư mục ra ngoài folder public_html.\nSau khi ấn Move, một bảng hiện lên. Bạn xóa đoạn /wordpress trong đường dẫn. Chỉ để lại đường dẫn là /public_html và ấn Move files.\nGiờ bạn quay lại thư mục public_html và ấn giữ phím Ctrl rồi click chọn thư mục wordpress và file wordpress-6.0.1.zip. Sau đó, chọn Delete để xóa 2 file và thư mục này đi.\nBảng thông báo hiện lên thì bạn cứ ấn vào Comfirm để xác nhận xóa.\nCuối cùng, trong thư mục public_html bạn sẽ thấy là toàn bộ source code WordPress như sau.\n3. Tạo database, tạo user và phân quyền user sử dụng database\nQuay lại trang chủ cPanel, bạn kéo xuống tìm nhóm Databases và chọn mục MySQL® Databases.\nTại mục Create New Database, bạn nhập tên database mới vào và ấn Create Database.\nGiả sử, mình nhập vào là thichvietblog. Như vậy mình sẽ có tên database đầy đủ là ehdzcakb_thichvietblog\nThông báo tạo database thành công hiện ra, bạn click vào Go back để quay trở lại.\nTiếp theo, bạn kéo xuống dưới sẽ thấy mục MySQL Users. Ở đây, bạn cần tạo 1 user mới cho database như sau.\nUsername: Nhập vào tên user. Ví dụ mình nhập là nguyenhung Password: Bạn đặt mật khẩu càng mạnh càng tốt. Có thể sử dụng công cụ Password Generator để tạo mật khẩu mạnh ngẫu nhiên. Ví dụ mình đặt là: HR0$6!\u0026D2;oezn~h Như vậy là mình có username: ehdzcakb_nguyenhung là và mật khẩu là: HR0$6!\u0026D2;oezn~h\nSau khi nhập xong, ấn Create User để tạo user cho database.\nThông báo tạo MySQL user thành công hiện ra, bạn click vào Go back để quay trở lại.\nCuối cùng, để cho user vừa tạo có quyền điều khiển database bạn kéo xuống mục Add User To Database.\nMục User bạn chọn đúng user vừa tạo, mục Database bạn chọn đúng database vừa tạo ở trên. Sau đó ấn Add.\nSau khi ấn Add, bạn sẽ cần phải chọn quyền cho user. Ở đây, mình sẽ cấp toàn bộ quyền nên mình tích vào ALL PRIVILEGES để chọn nhanh. Sau đó ấn Make Changes để áp dụng.\nSau khi hoàn tất, ấn Go back để quay lại.\nTại trang MySQL® Databases, bạn kéo xuống mục Current Databases sẽ thấy database được phân quyền cho user.\nNhư vậy, chúng ta đã hoàn tất việc tạo database, tạo user và phân quyền. Sau bước này, sẽ có các thông tin cần lưu lại bao gồm:\nDatabase: ehdzcakb_thichvietblog Username: ehdzcakb_nguyenhung Password: HR0$6!\u0026D2;oezn~h Các thông tin này sẽ cần dùng tới khi chúng ta cài đặt WordPress.\n4. Cài đặt website WordPress\nBạn mở tab mới trình duyệt web và nhập vào tên miền của bạn rồi ấn Enter.\nCác bước cài đặt web WordPress lần lượt như sau.\nNgay màn hình đầu tiên, bạn kéo xuống dưới cùng và chọn Tiếng Việt rồi ấn Tiếp tục.\nHệ thống nhắc nhở bạn chuẩn bị các thông tin như tên database, username và mật khẩu.\nNhững thứ này chúng ta đã chuẩn bị đầy đủ ở phía trên rồi nên giờ hãy mạnh dạn ấn Thực hiện ngay!\nĐến đây, chúng ta nhập vào tên database, username, password vào các ô tương ứng. Ngoài ra, các mục còn lại bạn cứ để nguyên và ấn Gửi.\nNếu mọi thứ đều hoàn hảo thì màn hình như sau sẽ hiện lên. Bạn hãy ấn Bắt đầu cài đặt để tiếp tục.\nĐến đây, bạn nhập vào thông tin cài đặt WordPress tương ứng như trong hình dưới.\nTrong đó:\nTên website: Là tên gọi của web Tên người dùng: Là tên dùng để đăng nhập vào trang quản trị Mật khẩu: Mật khẩu của người dùng quản trị Email: Nhập vào email của bạn để nhận thông tin liên quan tới trang web. Hiển thị với công cụ tìm kiếm: Bạn không tích vào nếu muốn website được Google index. Sau khi điền xong bạn ấn vào Cài đặt WordPress.\nNgay lập tức là thông báo việc tạo trang web WordPress đã thành công hiện lên.\nBạn có thể ấn vào Đăng nhập để vào trang quản trị của web.\nVà đây là giao diện trang quản trị web WordPress của bạn.\nCòn đây là giao diện bên ngoài trang chủ trang web của bạn ngay sau khi cài đặt xong.\nNhư vậy là bạn đã cài đặt WordPress xong và cũng hoàn thành những bước cơ bản trong việc tạo trang web rồi đó.\nVideo hướng dẫn tạo website bằng WordPress theo 2 cách\nĐể trang web của bạn hoàn chỉnh và đẹp hơn thì bạn làm tiếp theo bước 3 và 4 ở bên dưới nữa nhé.\nBước 3: Thiết lập cơ bản cho web Sau khi tạo trang web xong, bạn sẽ cần thiết lập một số mục cơ bản dưới đây để web của bạn được hoàn chỉnh hơn.\n1. Xóa hết bài viết và trang mặc định\nMặc định, WordPress sẽ tạo sẵn một bài viết và trang để bạn tham khảo. Tuy nhiên, bài viết và trang đó lại được để ở chế độ public nên nếu bạn không xóa thì sẽ được Google index với nội dung chẳng liên quan gì tới web của bạn làm ảnh hưởng tới SEO.\nThế nên, bạn hãy xóa nó đi bằng cách truy cập vào trang quản trị và chọn menu Bài viết -\u003e Tất cả bài viết và xóa bài viết “Chào tất cả mọi người!” đi.\nTương tự, bạn vào menu Trang -\u003e Tất cả các trang và xóa trang “Trang Mẫu” đi.\nSau cùng, bạn nhớ vào tab thùng rác và xóa hết trong thùng rác đi nhé.\n2. Chỉnh sửa tên blog và thiết lập định dạng thời gian\nBạn truy cập vào menu Cài đặt -\u003e Tổng quan để thiết lập Tên website, Ngôn ngữ của trang, Múi giờ, Định dạng ngày tháng và giờ phút.\nBạn có thể thiết lập các mục tùy ý sao cho phù hợp với trang web. Sau khi thiết lập xong nhớ ấn Lưu thay đổi.\nChú ý: Mục Gói thành viên và Vai trò của thành viên mới. Nếu bạn muốn cho người đọc đăng ký tài khoản thì tích vào mục Ai cũng có thể đăng ký. Đặc biệt chú ý mục vài trò thành viên, bạn chỉ nên để là Thành viên đăng ký hoặc Cộng tác viên. Còn những vai trò khác bạn cần tìm hiểu rõ quyền của từng vai trò để chọn cho phù hợp tránh bị người khác chiếm quyền quản trị web.\n3. Thiết lập bình luận trên trang web WordPress\nChức năng bình luận là chức năng rất hay của WordPress. Dù bạn làm blog cá nhân hay web bán hàng thì cũng rất cần những bình luận của độc giả để tăng tương tác.\nĐể dễ dàng quản lý bình luận của độc giả thì bạn cần thiết lập một số mục cơ bản như hình dưới. Đây là thiết lập chuẩn mà mình thường áp dụng.\nNgoài ra, bạn cũng dễ dàng đọc hiểu chức năng của từng mục để thiết lập nên mình không giải thích thêm tránh dài dòng.\nĐể quản lý bình luận, bạn truy cập menu Cài đặt -\u003e Thảo luận và thiết lập như sau.\nCũng trong mục này, bạn kéo xuống dưới để thiết lập ảnh đại diện cho người tham gia bình luận.\n4. Thiết lập tối ưu hình ảnh\nMặc định khi tải ảnh lên, WordPress sẽ cắt ảnh ra thành 3 file với các size ảnh khác nhau. Việc này về lâu về dài sẽ làm tốn bộ nhớ của hosting và gây chậm web.\nChính vì thế, bạn nên vào phần Cài đặt -\u003e Media và đặt hết các mục khoanh đỏ trong hình về 0 và lưu lại.\n5. Thiết lập cấu trúc đường link bài viết\nMặc định, đường link bài viết trong WordPress sẽ để ở dạng: https://thichvietblog.com/2022/07/23/bai-mau/\nCấu trúc này làm đường link dài dòng, khó nhớ, không thân thiện và không tốt cho SEO. Chính vì thế, cần phải thiết lập lại cho đường link đẹp hơn.\nBạn truy cập menu Cài đặt -\u003e Đường dẫn tĩnh và thiết lập lại đường link trong mục Cài đặt cơ bản.\nBạn có thể chọn nhanh các mẫu đường link có sẵn hoặc tùy chỉnh ở mục Tùy biến.\nCá nhân Nguyễn Hùng thường hay dùng định dạng link tên bài viết và thêm .html ở cuối. Nên mình cài đặt trong mục tùy biến dạng /%postname%.html\nSau khi xong thì ấn Lưu thay đổi để lưu lại.\nBước 4: Cài đặt theme, plugin cần thiết cho web 1. Thay đổi theme cho web WordPress\nNhư ở phần cuối của bước tạo trang web WordPress ở phía trên bạn cũng thấy, giao diện ngoài trang chủ mặc định sẽ không được đẹp lắm.\nChính vì thế, để có 1 giao diện web chuyên nghiệp hơn thì bạn cần phải thay đổi theme mới cho phù hợp hơn.\nBạn không phải lo lắng về vấn đề thay đổi giao diện web khi không biết gì về lập trình. Bởi, WordPress đã có sẵn kho giao diện miễn phí và trả phí vô cùng đa dạng. Bạn chỉ việc chọn và cài đặt là xong.\nTùy thuộc vào mục đích của bạn làm web để làm gì rồi bạn hãy chọn theme cho phù hợp. Hiện tại trên kho theme miễn phí của WordPress có hàng chục nghìn theme với đủ các chủ đề khác nhau như theme blog cá nhân, theme bán hàng, theme làm trang giới thiệu dịch vụ y tế, giáo dục, du lịch,….\nĐể thay đổi theme cho web bạn vào trang quản trị web rồi chọn menu Giao diện -\u003e Giao diện. Sau đó chọn Thêm mới để cài theme mới cho web.\nNgay lập tức, 1 kho giao diện web hoàn toàn miễn phí hiện ra để cho bạn lựa chọn. Bạn có thể kéo xuống và xem ảnh screenshot của từng theme xem theme nào vừa mắt thì trỏ chuột vào đó.\nBạn sẽ thấy nút Xem trước hiện lên. Hãy click vào nút Xem trước để xem qua giao diện của theme đó. Có thể khi xem trước giao diện không giống như ảnh screenshot nhưng sau khi bạn cài vào web và tùy chỉnh thì sẽ được như ảnh screenshot thôi.\nCuối cùng, bạn thấy ưng theme nào thì chọn Cài đặt để cài theme đó cho web.\nBạn chờ khoảng vài phút để hệ thống tải và cài đặt. Sau đó, nút Kích hoạt sẽ hiện lên, bạn chỉ cần ấn Kích hoạt là trang web của bạn được thay đổi giao diện hoàn toàn.\nNgoài ra, nếu bạn có điều kiện có thể chọn mua theme trả phí sẽ giúp bạn có được giao diện chuyên nghiệp và đẹp hơn rất nhiều. Đặc biệt, theme trả phí giúp bảo mật tốt hơn và tốc độ load cũng nhanh hơn (tiền nào của nấy mà).\nVề theme trả phí thì bạn có thể tìm mua trên chợ Themeforest hoặc của nhà cung cấp nổi tiếng như MyThemeShop, GeneratePress, StudioPress,…\nDưới đây, mình share cho các bạn tên một số mẫu giao diện tốt nhất để làm các trang web thông dụng hiện tại đang được nhiều người sử dụng.\nTheme làm web bán hàng\nTheme Flatsome (213.491 lượt mua) – Xem chi tiết theme Theme Porto (81.252 lượt mua) – Xem chi tiết theme Theme WoodMart (56.181 lượt mua) – Xem chi tiết theme Theme làm blog cá nhân\nTheme Newspaper (131.559 lượt mua) – Xem chi tiết theme Theme Sahifa (28.992 lượt mua) – Xem chi tiết theme Theme Jnews (19.366 lượt mua) – Xem chi tiết theme Cách cài theme trả phí thì hơi khác 1 chút nhưng cũng không có gì là khó cả.\nĐể cài theme trả phí bạn cũng vào menu Giao diện -\u003e Thêm mới. Sau đó ở trang thêm mới bạn click vào Tải giao diện lên.\nBạn click vào Chọn tệp và tìm file theme mà nhà cung cấp đưa cho ở định dạng .zip và ấn vào Cài đặt là xong.\nNgoài ra, việc cài theme trả phí còn có cách khác là cài thông qua trình quản lý file FTP để upload lên thư mục /wp-content/themes. Về cách này, bạn xem chi tiết hơn trong bài hướng dẫn cài theme cho WordPress nhé.\nVậy là bạn biết cách cài theme cho web WordPress để thay đổi giao diện trang web rồi đó.\nTiếp theo, bạn sẽ cần biết cách cài đặt plugin WordPress để tạo thêm nhiều chức năng cho web.\n2. Cài đặt plugin cho web WordPress\nTuy theo từng nhu cầu mà bạn cài plugin có những chức năng khác nhau. Dưới đây mình sẽ liệt kê cho bạn một số plugin cần thiết mà web nào cũng cần phải cài.\nPlugin tối ưu SEO cho web: Rank Math SEO hoặc Yoast SEO Plugin tạo cache tăng tốc độ load: LiteSpeed Cache hoặc WP Rocket Plugin tạo form liên hệ: Contact Form 7 hoặc Contact Form by WPForms hoặc Ninja Forms Plugin backup dữ liệu: UpdraftPlus hoặc BackWPup Plugin hữu ích khác: Akismet, gửi email qua SMTP, plugin chèn quảng cáo,… Lưu ý: Chỉ nên cài 1 plugin cho 1 chức năng nào đó, không nên cài đồng thời 2 hay nhiều plugin dễ gây xung đột và nặng web. Ngoài ra, cài nhiều plugin sẽ làm web load chậm hơn nên bạn chỉ cài plugin khi thấy cần thiết.\nĐể cài đặt plugin lên web WordPress bạn làm theo hướng dẫn sau.\nTruy cập vào trang quản trị và chọn menu Plugin -\u003e Cài mới. Sau đó bạn tìm tên plugin muốn cài ở trong ô tìm kiếm.\nBạn cần tìm đúng plugin cần cài (nhìn đúng icon và số lượt cài plugin kẻo nhầm) và ấn vào Cài đặt.\nBạn chờ 1 vài phút để plugin cài đặt. Sau đó bạn cần ấn vào Kích hoạt để bật plugin lên.\nChú ý: Có những plugin sau khi kích hoạt xong bạn phải vào cấu hình nó mới hoạt động được theo ý. Thường những plugin như vậy sẽ tạo ra 1 menu ở bên tay trái hoặc nằm trong menu Cài đặt.\nĐó là cách cài đặt plugin miễn phí trên kho WordPress. Tuy nhiên, nếu bạn có điều kiện hơn hoặc bạn cần những chức năng chuyên sâu hơn thì bạn có thể tìm mua plugin trả phí trên Codecanyon, MythemeShop, Thrive,… hoặc các plugin trả phí như WP Rocket, Rank Math SEO Pro,…\nKhi đó bạn sẽ phải cài đặt plugin bằng cách tải lên file .zip từ máy tính (tương tự như cài theme trả phí ở trên).\nĐể cài plugin theo cách này bạn truy cập menu Plugin -\u003e Cài mới -\u003e Tải plugin lên. Sau đó, chọn file plugin ở định dạng .zip trên máy tính và ấn vào Cài đặt.\nCuối cùng, cũng giống như cài theme trả phí. Để cài plugin trả phí bạn cũng có thể cài thông qua trình quản lý file FTP để upload lên thư mục /wp-content/plugins. Tương tự, bạn đọc và làm theo hướng dẫn ở bài hướng dẫn cài plugin WordPress này.\nTới đây thì bạn đã gần như hoàn thiện trang web của mình chỉnh chu rồi. Bây giờ bạn có thể bắt đầu đăng bài lên web, đồng thời bạn hãy khai báo website với Google để cho Google index nội dung của bạn sớm và hiển thị web lên trang tìm kiếm Google.\nHỏi đáp liên quan đến cách tạo trang web Mình cũng từng có thời gian mò mẫm tìm hiểu về WordPress trong khi chưa biết gì về lập trình. Chính vì thế, mình hiểu được những khó khăn ban đầu mà bạn gặp phải khi tìm cách tạo trang web với WordPress.\nNếu bạn có bất cứ vấn đề gì, đừng ngần ngại đặt câu hỏi cho mình qua ô bình luận phía dưới. Ngoài ra, dưới đây là một số thắc mắc mà nhiều bạn gặp phải nên mình giải đáp luôn ở đây.\n1. Tạo trang web không dùng WordPress được không? Hoàn toàn được! Bạn có thể code web bằng tay hoặc sử dụng nền tảng khác như Joomla, NukeViet, Shopify, Wix,… Tuy nhiên, với bản thân mình sau khi trải nghiệm thử qua các nền tảng thì thấy WordPress vẫn là số 1.\n2. Tạo trang web không cần tên miền và hosting có được không? Được! Hiện tại có rất nhiều nền tảng hỗ trợ tạo trang web mà không cần phải có tên miền hay hosting. Ví dụ như Blogger của Google hoặc bản miễn phí của Wix, Ladipage. Tuy nhiên, để làm trang web chuyên nghiệp thì bạn nên có ít nhất là tên miền riêng.\n3. Tạo trang web bằng WordPress sẽ SEO tốt hơn? Cũng không hoàn toàn. Việc WordPress hỗ trợ SEO tốt là do WordPress có những plugin tối ưu SEO chuyên nghiệp như Rank Math, Yoast SEO. Tuy nhiên, nếu bạn không biết cách sử dụng tốt các plugin này thì cũng không mang lại hiệu quả.\nLời kết\nTới đây bài viết đã quá dài rồi!\nNhưng vì muốn hướng dẫn thật chi tiết để bạn hiểu được cách tạo website bằng WordPress là như nào nên dài 1 chút cũng không sao.\nHi vọng với các bước hướng dẫn tạo web bằng WordPress sẽ giúp bạn làm được blog cá nhân hoặc làm web shop bán hàng. Trong các bước sẽ có một số bài hướng dẫn chi tiết hơn mà mình đã để link, bạn cố gắng đọc hết để hiểu hơn nha.\nBài viết này sẽ dừng ở mức giúp bạn tạo được website bằng WordPress. Sau khi hoàn thành xong trang web bạn sẽ còn nhiều việc phải làm để phát triển trang web như:\nCài đặt giao diện web chuyên nghiệp hơn với các theme từ bên thứ 3. Cài thêm plugin để tạo các chức năng bạn muốn. Phát triển nội dung cho web Tối ưu hóa SEO cho web …. Những nội dung đó sẽ không được đề cập trong bài viết này mà mình sẽ cập nhật trong chuyên mục WordPress bạn có thể tìm kiếm trong đó.\nNgoài ra, nếu có bất cứ thắc mắc hoặc gặp lỗi gì liên quan trên WordPress bạn có thể comment ở bên dưới hoặc liên hệ với mình để được hỗ trợ.\nCuối cùng, nếu thấy bài viết hữu ích hãy giúp mình chia sẻ tới mọi người để được nhiều người biết tới bài viết này hơn.

GitHub Pages is available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see “GitHub’s plans.”\nAbout Jekyll Jekyll is a static site generator with built-in support for GitHub Pages and a simplified build process. Jekyll takes Markdown and HTML files and creates a complete static website based on your choice of layouts. Jekyll supports Markdown and Liquid, a templating language that loads dynamic content on your site. For more information, see Jekyll.\nJekyll is not officially supported for Windows. For more information, see “Jekyll on Windows” in the Jekyll documentation.\nWe recommend using Jekyll with GitHub Pages. If you prefer, you can use other static site generators or customize your own build process locally or on another server. For more information, see “About GitHub Pages.”\nConfiguring Jekyll in your GitHub Pages site You can configure most Jekyll settings, such as your site’s theme and plugins, by editing your _config.yml file. For more information, see “Configuration” in the Jekyll documentation.\nSome configuration settings cannot be changed for GitHub Pages sites.\nlsi: false safe: true source: [your repo's top level directory] incremental: false highlighter: rouge gist: noscript: false kramdown: math_engine: mathjax syntax_highlighter: rougeBy default, Jekyll doesn’t build files or folders that:\nare located in a folder called /node_modules or /vendor start with _, ., or # end with ~ are excluded by the exclude setting in your configuration file If you want Jekyll to process any of these files, you can use the include setting in your configuration file.\nFront matter To set variables and metadata, such as a title and layout, for a page or post on your site, you can add YAML front matter to the top of any Markdown or HTML file. For more information, see “Front Matter” in the Jekyll documentation.\nYou can add site.github to a post or page to add any repository references metadata to your site. For more information, see “Using site.github” in the Jekyll Metadata documentation.\nThemes You can add a Jekyll theme to your GitHub Pages site to customize the look and feel of your site. For more information, see “Themes” in the Jekyll documentation.\nYou can add a supported theme to your site on GitHub. For more information, see “Supported themes” on the GitHub Pages site and “Adding a theme to your GitHub Pages site using Jekyll”.\nTo use any other open source Jekyll theme hosted on GitHub, you can add the theme manually. For more information, see themes hosted on GitHub and “Adding a theme to your GitHub Pages site using Jekyll”.\nYou can override any of your theme’s defaults by editing the theme’s files. For more information, see your theme’s documentation and “Overriding your theme’s defaults” in the Jekyll documentation.\nPlugins You can download or create Jekyll plugins to extend the functionality of Jekyll for your site. For example, the jemoji plugin lets you use GitHub-flavored emoji in any page on your site the same way you would on GitHub. For more information, see “Plugins” in the Jekyll documentation.\nGitHub Pages uses plugins that are enabled by default and cannot be disabled:\njekyll-coffeescript jekyll-default-layout jekyll-gist jekyll-github-metadata jekyll-optional-front-matter jekyll-paginate jekyll-readme-index jekyll-titles-from-headings jekyll-relative-links You can enable additional plugins by adding the plugin’s gem to the plugins setting in your _config.yml file. For more information, see “Configuration” in the Jekyll documentation.\nFor a list of supported plugins, see “Dependency versions” on the GitHub Pages site. For usage information for a specific plugin, see the plugin’s documentation.\nGitHub Pages cannot build sites using unsupported plugins. If you want to use unsupported plugins, generate your site locally and then push your site’s static files to GitHub.\nSyntax highlighting To make your site easier to read, code snippets are highlighted on GitHub Pages sites the same way they’re highlighted on GitHub. For more information about syntax highlighting on GitHub, see “Creating and highlighting code blocks.”\nBy default, code blocks on your site will be highlighted by Jekyll. Jekyll uses the Rouge highlighter (which is compatible with Pygments). If you specify Pygments in your _config.yml file, Rouge will be used as the fallback instead. Jekyll cannot use any other syntax highlighter, and you’ll get a page build warning if you specify another syntax highlighter in your _config.yml file. For more information, see “About Jekyll build errors for GitHub Pages sites.”\nIf you want to use another highlighter, such as highlight.js, you must disable Jekyll’s syntax highlighting by updating your project’s _config.yml file.\nkramdown: syntax_highlighter_opts: disable : trueIf your theme doesn’t include CSS for syntax highlighting, you can generate GitHub’s syntax highlighting CSS and add it to your project’s style.css file.\nrougify style github \u003e style.cssBuilding your site locally If you are publishing from a branch, changes to your site are published automatically when the changes are merged into your site’s publishing source. If you are publishing from a custom GitHub Actions workflow, changes are published whenever your workflow is triggered (typically by a push to the default branch). If you want to preview your changes first, you can make the changes locally instead of on GitHub. Then, test your site locally. For more information, see “Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll.”\n",

Đó là điều khiến khu vườn kỹ thuật số trở nên thú vị.\nTải xuống và cài đặt plugin cộng đồng Digital Garden trong Obsidian. Tiếp theo, bạn sẽ cần một tài khoản GitHub. Nếu bạn không có cái này, hãy tạo một cái ở đây . Bạn cũng sẽ cần một tài khoản Vercel. Bạn có thể đăng ký bằng tài khoản GitHub của mình tại đây Mở repo này và nhấp vào nút “Triển khai lên Vercel” màu xanh lam. Thao tác này sẽ mở Vercel và tạo bản sao của kho lưu trữ này trong tài khoản GitHub của bạn. Đặt cho nó một cái tên phù hợp như ‘khu vườn kỹ thuật số của tôi’. Làm theo các bước trong Vercel để xuất bản trang web của bạn lên internet.\nTiếp theo, bạn cần tạo mã thông báo truy cập vào Tài khoản GitHub của mình. Điều này hoạt động như một loại mật khẩu để plugin có thể thay mặt bạn thêm ghi chú mới vào kho lưu trữ GitHub. Truy cập trang này khi đăng nhập vào GitHub. Các cài đặt chính xác đã được áp dụng. (Nếu bạn không muốn tạo mã này vài tháng một lần, hãy chọn tùy chọn “Không hết hạn”.) Nhấp vào nút “Tạo mã thông báo” và sao chép mã thông báo mà bạn thấy trên trang tiếp theo. GitHub gần đây đã ra mắt một tính năng beta mới, nơi bạn có thể nhắm mục tiêu những kho lưu trữ mà mã thông báo có quyền truy cập. Đây hiện là cách an toàn nhất để sử dụng plugin. Xem Mã thông báo truy cập chi tiết để biết chi tiết về cách tạo mã này.\nMở Obsidian và cài đặt cho “Digital Garden” rồi điền tên người dùng GitHub của bạn, tên của kho lưu trữ cùng với các ghi chú mà bạn đã tạo ở bước 3 và cuối cùng dán mã thông báo của bạn.\nBây giờ, hãy xuất bản ghi chú đầu tiên của bạn! Tạo ghi chú mới trong Obsidian. Bây giờ thêm hai thuộc tính mới vào ghi chú.\nGiúp đỡ! Làm cách nào để thêm thuộc tính vào ghi chú\nMột hộp kiểm có têndg-publish Hộp kiểm có tên dg-home\nChuyển đổi cả hai hộp kiểm để chúng ở trạng checkedthái.\nNó sẽ trông giống như thế này:\nĐiều này thực hiện hai việc:\nCài đặt dg-home cho plugin biết rằng đây phải là trang chủ hoặc mục nhập vào khu vườn kỹ thuật số của bạn. (Nó chỉ cần được thêm vào một ghi chú, không phải mọi ghi chú bạn sẽ xuất bản).\nCài đặt dg-publish cho plugin biết rằng ghi chú này sẽ được xuất bản lên khu vườn kỹ thuật số của bạn. Ghi chú không có cài đặt này sẽ không được xuất bản. (Nói cách khác: Mọi ghi chú bạn xuất bản sẽ cần thuộc tính này.)\nMở bảng lệnh của bạn bằng cách nhấn CTRL+P trên Windows/Linux (CMD+P trên Mac) và tìm lệnh “Digital Garden: Publish Single Note”. Bấm phím Enter. Truy cập URL trang web của bạn mà bạn sẽ tìm thấy trên Vercel . Nếu chưa có gì xuất hiện, hãy đợi một phút và làm mới. Ghi chú của bạn bây giờ sẽ xuất hiện. Xin chúc mừng, giờ đây bạn đã có phần Internet cá nhân của riêng mình dưới dạng một khu vườn kỹ thuật số, miễn phí 🎉.\nBây giờ bạn có thể bắt đầu thêm các liên kết như bạn thường làm trong Obisidan, với dấu ngoặc vuông kép, vào ghi chú mà bạn vừa xuất bản.\nHãy nhớ xuất bản các ghi chú mà bạn đang liên kết vì điều này sẽ không tự động xảy ra. Đây là do thiết kế. Bạn luôn kiểm soát được những ghi chú mà bạn thực sự muốn xuất bản. Nếu bạn không xuất bản ghi chú được liên kết, liên kết sẽ chỉ dẫn đến một trang web thông báo cho người dùng rằng ghi chú này không tồn tại.\nNếu bạn muốn hủy xuất bản một ghi chú mà không xóa ghi chú khỏi vault của mình, chỉ cần bỏ chọn hoặc xóa thuộc tính dg-publish trong ghi chú, mở trung tâm xuất bản và nhấp vào nút “Xóa ghi chú khỏi vườn”.\nBây giờ bạn đã thiết lập và chạy, bạn có thể xem các lệnh có sẵn hoặc các cài đặt ghi chú có sẵn khác nhau .

Cài đặt được đặt ở đây là cài đặt mặc định chung được sử dụng cho mỗi ghi chú được xuất bản. Nếu bạn muốn kiểm soát chi tiết hơn và tắt hoặc bật một số tính năng cho một số ghi chú cụ thể, bạn có thể thực hiện việc này thông qua nội dung phía trước. Tất cả các cài đặt đều có sự tương đương về vật chất/ thuộc tính phía trước được viết trong dấu ngoặc đơn phía sau cài đặt.\nVì vậy, nếu bạn đã bật tìm kiếm trên toàn cầu, nhưng có một lưu ý là bạn muốn tắt tính năng này, bạn có thể làm như vậy bằng cách đặt thành dg-enable-searchsai:\ndg-publish: true\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\rdg-enable-search: false\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003eHoặc ngược lại: Nếu bạn đã tắt biểu đồ trên toàn cầu nhưng có ghi chú ở nơi bạn muốn nó hiển thị, bạn có thể đặt giá trị này dg-show-local-graphthành true.\ndg-publish: true\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\rdg-show-local-graph: true\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003eSau khi giới thiệu các thuộc tính , Obsidian không đặt rõ ràng giá trị “sai” cần thiết vào các thuộc tính của hộp kiểm khi chúng không được chọn. Hiện tại, bạn sẽ cần sử dụng các thuộc tính làm loại văn bản khi muốn tắt cài đặt trên một ghi chú cụ thể. Ví dụ: thuộc tính của ghi chú Trang đơn giản trông như thế này:\nCài đặt có sẵn Hiển thị liên kết trang chủ Bật theo mặc định. Nếu tính năng này được bật, thanh điều hướng sẽ hiển thị ở đầu mỗi ghi chú. Tên trang web sẽ được hiển thị dưới dạng tiêu đề và có thể nhấp vào. Nhấp vào nó sẽ đưa người dùng quay lại ghi chú chính. Theo mặc định tên trang web là “Digital Garden”. Điều này có thể được thay đổi thông qua 04 cài đặt Cài đặt giao diện#Tên trang web .\nHiển thị biểu đồ cục bộ cho ghi chú Tắt theo mặc định. Khi bật biểu đồ cục bộ, giống như biểu đồ trong Obsidian, sẽ được hiển thị ở bên phải. Nó sẽ hiển thị cả liên kết gửi đi và đến ghi chú hiện tại. Nó có tính tương tác và có thể được di chuyển xung quanh. Nhấp vào một trong các nút sẽ đưa bạn đến ghi chú tương ứng.\nTrên máy tính để bàn, nó được hiển thị bên phải. Trên thiết bị di động, nó được hiển thị ở phía dưới.\nHiển thị bảng nội dung cho ghi chú Tắt theo mặc định. Khi được bật, danh sách tất cả các tiêu đề trong ghi chú của bạn sẽ được hiển thị ở bên phải. Nhấp vào một tiêu đề sẽ cuộn đến tiêu đề tương ứng trong ghi chú.\nTrên máy tính để bàn, nó được hiển thị bên phải. Trên di động nó bị ẩn.\nHiển thị liên kết ngược cho ghi chú Tắt theo mặc định. Khi được bật, ghi chú đã xuất bản của bạn sẽ hiển thị danh sách các ghi chú liên kết ngược lại với nó. Nó sẽ chỉ hiển thị các ghi chú đã được xuất bản.\nTrên máy tính để bàn và màn hình lớn hơn, nó sẽ được đặt ở bên phải. Trên thiết bị di động và màn hình nhỏ hơn, nó được đặt ở cuối trang.\nHiển thị tiêu đề nội tuyến Tắt theo mặc định. Khi được bật, tên tệp sẽ được hiển thị trên đầu trang. Tương tự như cài đặt “Hiển thị tiêu đề nội tuyến” được giới thiệu trong Obsidian v1.0.\nTắt theo mặc định. Khi được bật, một thanh bên sẽ được hiển thị ở bên phải, với tất cả các ghi chú đã xuất bản của bạn được hiển thị theo hệ thống phân cấp thư mục mà chúng được đặt trong Obsidian. Trên màn hình nhỏ hơn, nó sẽ biến mất nhưng có thể xem được bằng cách nhấp vào menu “hamburger” ở góc trên cùng bên trái.\nXem trước liên kết Tắt theo mặc định. Khi bật, tất cả các liên kết sẽ hiển thị bản xem trước nội dung ghi chú khi bạn di chuột qua chúng.\nBật tìm kiếm Tắt theo mặc định. Khi được bật, người dùng có tùy chọn dễ dàng tìm kiếm trong tất cả các ghi chú đã xuất bản của bạn. Bạn có thể xem hộp tìm kiếm bằng cách nhấp vào hộp tìm kiếm xuất hiện ở góc trên bên phải hoặc trên đầu thanh bên filetree nếu tính năng này được bật. Nó cũng có thể được kích hoạt bằng cách nhấn CTRL+K trên Windows/Linux hoặc CMD+K trên MacOS.\nMột hộp thoại sẽ bật lên. Kết quả có thể được điều hướng bằng cách sử dụng bàn phím của bạn bằng các phím mũi tên lên và xuống. Nhấn enter sẽ đưa bạn đến ghi chú. Nhấn ESC sẽ đóng hộp tìm kiếm.\nKhi tìm kiếm được bật, bạn cũng có thể tạo các URL hiển thị tìm kiếm và kết quả. Điều này được thực hiện bằng cách chỉ định tham số truy vấn “q” trong URL.\nVí dụ: đối với trang web này: https://dg-docs.ole.dev/?q=Commands\nHiển thị thẻ Tắt theo mặc định. Khi được bật, mọi thẻ trong phần đầu của ghi chú sẽ hiển thị ở đầu trang, ngay dưới tiêu đề ghi chú.\nNếu tìm kiếm được bật, việc nhấp vào thẻ sẽ hiển thị hộp tìm kiếm và hiển thị tất cả các ghi chú có thẻ đó.\nHãy để tất cả vấn đề phía trước thông qua Tắt theo mặc định. Hầu hết người dùng muốn tắt tính năng này. Đây là cài đặt chủ yếu dành cho người dùng nâng cao, những người sửa đổi mẫu của họ và muốn có toàn quyền kiểm soát những gì nội dung chính được chuyển đến mẫu. Theo mặc định, tất cả các thuộc tính của frontmatter không được plugin nhận dạng sẽ bị loại bỏ trước khi xuất bản. Điều này nhằm ngăn quá trình xây dựng trong Netlify không thành công nếu có dữ liệu ở phần đầu không được trình tạo trang tĩnh nhận ra. (Xem Dữ liệu về vấn đề phía trước của 11ty để biết chi tiết về điều này). Nếu trang web của bạn đột nhiên ngừng hoạt động và tính năng này được bật thì bạn nên thử tắt nó lại.\nCài đặt dành riêng cho ghi chú Ngoài ra còn có một số Cài đặt cụ thể cho ghi chú không có trong chế độ xem “Cài đặt ghi chú”. Đây là những cài đặt chỉ có thể được đặt cho các ghi chú cụ thể. Tổng quan về những điều này có sẵn ở đây .\n\u003c Trước | Tiếp theo: Cài đặt giao diện \u003e\n",

Đến nay, Git trở thành một trong các phần mềm quản lý mã nguồn phổ biến nhất.\nVà trong bài viết này, mình chỉ xin giới thiệu về cách hoạt động và các câu lệnh cơ bản của Git, còn việc cài đặt và cấu hình thì có rất nhiều bài hướng dẫn trên đây rồi. 2. Bắt đầu với git và cấu trúc hoạt động của nó: Hình ảnh dưới đây thể hiện các hoạt động mà người dùng tương tác với hệ thống Git Ở đây chúng ra sẽ tìm hiểu về khái niệm Repository: hay được gọi tắt là Repo đơn giản là nơi chứa/cơ sở dữ liệu (database) tất cả những thông tin cần thiết để duy trì và quản lý các sửa đổi và lịch sử của dự án (theo wikipedia.org). Và trong hình ảnh trên, ta thấy có 2 loại Repo là Repo bên phía Server (Remote Repository) và Repo bên phía Workstation (Local Repository): Remote repository: Là repository để chia sẻ giữa nhiều người và bố trí trên server chuyên dụng. Local repository: Là repository bố trí trên máy của bản thân mình, dành cho một người dùng sử dụng. Về cách hoạt động: Lập trình viên sẽ làm việc trực tiếp với “Local Repo”, và sau khi hoàn thành công việc của mình sẽ lưu commit trên “Local Repo” rồi push request lên “Remote Repo”. Remote Repo sẽ do Team-Lead quản lí, sẽ kiểm tra trước ghi quyết định có gộp request đó vào hay không. Nếu không sẽ thông báo cho lập trình viên sửa lại rồi gửi lại request. Đến khi có request được gộp vào Remote Repo, tất cả các máy cá nhân (Local Repo) sẽ phải tải lại bản mới nhất trên Remote Repo về và tiếp tục làm việc. Hoạt động trên Repository: Khái niệm branch: dùng để phân nhánh và ghi lại luồng của lịch sử. Branch đã phân nhánh sẽ không ảnh hưởng đến branch khác nên có thể tiến hành nhiều thay đổi đồng thời trong cùng 1 repository. Hơn nữa, branch đã phân nhánh có thể chỉnh sửa tổng hợp lại thành 1 branch bằng việc hợp lại (merge) với branch khác.\nGit sẽ quản lí code giống như sơ đồ xương cá với 1 nhánh chính là branch Master (nhánh màu xanh lá).\nKhi bạn bắt đầu làm việc, bạn sẽ phải tạo một branch khác và làm việc trên đó. Đến khi phần công việc đó hoàn thành, bạn có thể gộp nó vào branch master rồi tiếp tục thực hiện phần việc khác, và lịch sử sửa đổi này sẽ được lưu lại (nếu cần có thể quay trở về giống như Ctrl Z vậy).\nCHÚ Ý:\nMỗi branch chỉ nên thực hiện một công việc cụ thể Branch mới bắt buộc phải được tạo ra từ branch master (chứ không phải một branch nhánh khác) 3. Các câu lệnh cơ bản: Quản lý branch: Kiểm tra danh sách branch: $ git branch , để thực thi trên remote repo, ta chỉ cần cho thêm tùy chọn -r hoặc --remote Xóa branch: khi đang ở branch khác: $ git branch -d \u003cbranch_name\u003e khi đang ở branch cùng tên với remote branch muốn xóa: $ git push \u003cremote_name\u003e -d \u003cbranch_name\u003e Push branch từ Local lên Remote với tên khác: Bình thường, việc push một branch ở local lên remote branch được thực hiện bằng cách: $ git push \u003cremote_name\u003e \u003cbranch_name\u003e Tuy nhiên việc push dưới một tên khác sẽ có khác biệt, cụ thể: $ git push \u003cremote_name\u003e \u003clocal_branch_name\u003e:\u003cremote_branch_name\u003e Rebase và merge: Rebase:\n$ git checkout \u003cbranch_name\u003e\n$ git rebase \u003crebase_branch_name\u003e\nCách thực hiện: Lấy code từ rebase_branch_name sau đó từ những commit ở đó tạo ra những commit tương tự lên branch_name. Thực hiện rebase thì các commit đã tồn tại bị bỏ đi và tái tạo lại các commit tương tự nhưng thực ra là khác biệt. Điều này làm lịch sử commit ở local và remote khác nhau. Đặc điểm: các commit của nhánh được tạo mới sẽ nằm liền mạch, và các commit của rebase-branch sẽ là các commit mới nhất. Merge:\n$ git checkout \u003cbranch_name\u003e\n$ git merge \u003cbranch_2_name\u003e\nCách thực hiện: git dùng 2 bản commit cuối cùng của từng nhánh rồi tích hợp lại với nhau tạo thành 1 commit mới theo kiểu hình thoi. Thực hiện merge thì các commit đã tồn tại không bị thay đổi, chỉ tạo ra 1 commit mới tích hợp của 2 commit mới nhất. Đặc điểm: các commit của 2 nhánh được sắp xếp theo thời gian tạo commit. Gộp commit: Tùy vào từng môi trường, công ty khác nhau sẽ có những yêu cầu khác nhau về việc quản lý commit. Ví dụ công ty yêu cầu mỗi request bạn gửi lên chỉ có duy nhất 1 commit. Bạn vào kiểm tra thì lại thấy nhiều hơn, thì công việc của bạn là gộp những commit ấy lại. Và việc thực hiện sẽ ra sao?\n$ git rebase -i \u003cid_commit_end\u003e || $ git rebase -i HEAD~\u003cindex\u003e\n\u003cid_commit_end\u003e là id của commit cuối trong nhóm cần gộp. : số commit cần gộp. Sau đó, cửa sổ làm việc hiện lên, Ta có các lựa chọn pick|squash|fixup các commit trước khi save. Sau đó kiểm tra lại bằng lệnh: $ git log --oneline xem commit đã được gộp thành công hay chưa.\nGit stash: Khi đang làm việc với một branch rồi bạn chợt nhận ra mình cần sửa ở branch cũ, bạn sẽ cần checkout và phải commit những thay đổi. Tuy nhiên, bạn chỉ cần lưu nó lại mà chưa commit, và git stash sẽ giúp bạn. Ngoài ra, có 1 số tuỳ chọn như:\nXem lại lịch sử thay đổi: $ git stash list Xem lại lịch sử thay đổi cùng nội dung của nó: $ git stash list -p Xem lại lịch sử thay đổi: $ git stash list Xem lại lịch sử thay đổi cụ thể của lần 1: $ git stash show stash@{1} Apply thay đổi của lần 1: $ git stash apply stash@{1} Xoá thay đổi: $ git stash drop stash@{1} Xoá toàn bộ: $ git stash clear Git reset: Trong cuộc sống, mọi hành động thì không thể “hoàn tác” được. Nhưng khi làm việc với máy tính, Ctrl-Z luôn sẵn sàng để sửa chữa sai lầm cho bạn, và git cung cấp cho bạn 3 phương pháp:\n$ git reset \u003ccommit_id\u003e khi ta muốn di chuyển HEAD đến commit reset và giữ nguyên tất cả thay đổi của file đến vị trị hiện tại. Tuy nhiên sẽ loại bỏ thay đổi khỏi stage. $ git reset --hard \u003ccommit_id\u003e khi nó vẫn di chuyển HEAD đến commit reset nhưng sẽ loại bỏ tất cả thay đổi của file sau commit reset. $ git reset --soft \u003ccommit_id\u003e khi muốn di chuyển HEAD đến commit reset và có ưu điểm là sẽ giữ nguyên tất cả thay đổi của file và các thay đổi ở stage. –\u003e vì vậy reset –soft được khuyến khích sử dụng hơn, tuy vậy, bạn cũng nên tùy chọn phù hợp với hoàn cảnh và mục đích bạn mong muốn. Kết luận: Trên đây chỉ là một số tình huống thường gặp khi làm việc với Git mà mình gặp phải. Ngoài ra, muốn trở thành Master Git thì mình khuyên các bạn nên lao vào làm thực tế, khi đó sẽ phát sinh ra nhiều tình huống hơn, giúp bạn nâng cao trình độ. Ngoài ra, cuốn Pro Git ở dưới sẽ giúp đỡ các bạn phần nào.\nCảm ơn các bạn và mong sớm gặp lại các bạn trong các bài viết tiếp theo.\nTham khảo: Khái niệm, lịch sử phát triển của Git: https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(phần_mềm)\nEbook Pro Git rất chi tiết, bài bản về git: https://git-scm.com/book/vi/v1/Bắt-Đầu-Cơ-Bản-về-Git\nhttps://viblo.asia/p/mot-vai-cau-hoi-ve-git-GrLZDAgOlk0\n",

Sử dụng công cụ 1 click Bước 1. Bạn sử dụng WinRAR hoặc 7-Zip để giải nén file Anhdv_Boot_Free_22.5.zip ra (bạn chọn là Extract Here nha, mình trỏ nhầm mũi tên @@)\nBước 2. Bạn nhấn chuột phải vào One_Click_Anhdv_Boot.bat =\u003e và chọn Run as administrator để chạy với quyền Admin.\nBạn chọn Yes nếu được hỏi ở cửa sổ tiếp theo nhé.\nBước 3. Chọn ngôn ngữ cho giao diện, ở đây mình sẽ chọn Tiếng Việt nên mình nhập 1 =\u003e và nhấn Enter.\nBước 4. Bước này, tools 1 click sẽ liệt kê tất cả các thiết bị lưu trữ hiện có trên máy tính.\nBạn hãy chọn đúng USB hoặc ổ cứng rời mà bạn muốn tạo khả năng boot (nhìn vào tên và dung lượng của thiết bị).\nVí dụ như của mình ở hình bên dưới là số 1. Mình sẽ nhập 1 =\u003e và nhấn Enter.\nBạn chú ý phần Lưu ý như trong hình bên dưới nữa nhé. Để nếu chẳng may USB của bạn có rơi vào trường hợp đó còn biết cách xử lý.\nBước 5. Bước này là bước lựa chọn xem bạn có muốn tạo USB phân vùng ẩn hay không.\nNhập N để tạo USB BOOT thường, tức là không có phân vùng ẩn. Nhập Y để tạo USB BOOT với phân vùng boot ẩn (ưu điểm là tránh bị virus phá boot). =\u003e Ở đây mình sẽ nhập y =\u003e nhấn Enter để tạo USB BOOT với phân vùng boot ẩn.\nBước 5. Ở bước này, nếu như bạn muốn copy thêm file hoặc gói mở rộng gì đó vào phân vùng boot thì nhập thêm dung lượng tương ứng vào (1GB = 1024 MB, cứ thế mà tính nha các bạn).\nMình không có nhu cầu tích hợp thêm gì nên sẽ không nhập thêm dung lượng, nhấn Enter để chuyển sang bước tiếp theo.\nCông cụ sẽ đưa ra cảnh báo là tất cả dữ liệu trên USB sẽ bị xóa, bạn nhấn y để xác nhận.\nBước 6. Quá trình xả nén và tạo khả năng boot đang diễn ra. Bạn ngồi chờ thôi… chắc cũng phải 10 – 15 phút đó.\nSau khi tạo USB BOOT thành công thì công cụ sẽ báo như hình bên dưới.\nBạn đọc phần Lưu ý trong hình nếu muốn sử dụng Linux hoặc là tích hợp thêm Antivirus nhé.\nBONUS:\nBạn lưu ý nhé, chỉ cần cắm USB vào máy tính =\u003e rồi chạy lại công cụ One_Click_Anhdv_Boot.bat là sẽ có những tính năng hữu ích như hình bên dưới.\nCập nhật USB BOOT lên phiên bản mới nhất mà không mất dữ liệu. Tạo mới USB BOOT. Hiện phân vùng ẩn (USB-BOOT), sử dụng tính năng này trong trường hợp bạn muốn copy thêm file mở rộng, hoặc sửa đổi giao diện.. Sửa lỗi hiển thị sai phân vùng, hiển thị đúng là sau khi tạo USB BOOT xong, bạn chỉ nhìn thấy phân vùng USB-DATA trên máy tính, còn phân vùng USB-BOOT sẽ bị ẩn. Xóa USB BOOT, kiểu Format lại USB BOOT phân vùng ẩn đó các bạn. Giao diện Anhdv Boot 2022\nCách #2. Sử dụng phần mềm Rufus Trang chủ: rufus.ie Phiên bản Rufus 3.xx : Link tải / Link từ trang chủ (nên dùng vì nó luôn là bản mới nhất) – nên sử dụng Portable Version để không phải cài đặt. Hoặc bạn mở thư mục Tools trong thư mục giải nén ra =\u003e rồi chạy công cụ rufus-3.20p.exe\nĐể tạo USB boot trên cả 2 chuẩn UEFI và LEGACY (BIOS) thì bạn hãy thiết lập như sau:\nBạn mở phần mềm Rufus lên =\u003e nhấn tổ hợp phím ALT + E để kích hoạt chế độ Dual UEFI/BIOS =\u003e nếu xuất hiện dòng chữ Dual UEFI/BIOS mode enabled như hình bên trên có nghĩa là OK rồi đấy.\nTiếp theo:\n(1) Chọn đúng thiết bị USB mà bạn muốn sử dụng. (2) Nhấn vào SELECT để chọn file ISO (bộ boot của Anhdv Boot). (3) Partition scheme: Bạn chọn là MBR (4) Target system: Bạn chọn là BIOS or UEFI (5) Bạn đặt tên cho USB của bạn. (6) File system: Bạn chọn NTFS =\u003e Cuối cùng nhấn vào START để bắt đầu và chờ cho đến khi hoàn thành. Xong !\nCách #3. Các sử dụng phần mềm UltraISO Bước 1. Bạn tải UltraISO tại đây \u003cđọc comment để biết cách kích hoạt bản quyền nha các bạn\u003e !\nBước 2. Sau đó bạn thiết lập như hình bên dưới nhé.\nIII. Một vài mẹo sử dụng dụng Anhdv Boot 2022 Với bộ công cụ Anhdv boot bạn có thể làm được khá nhiều thứ hay ho, bạn có thể đọc qua một vài hướng dẫn nổi bật sau đây.\n#1. Cách Test USB Boot Để biết USB BOOT có hoạt động được hay không mà không cần phải test trực tiếp trên máy tính thật thì bạn có thể sử dụng phần mềm để test.\nBạn mở thư mục Tools trong thư mục giải nén ra =\u003e rồi chạy công cụ QemuBootTester.exe để test.\n#2. Cách sử dụng phần mềm có trong WinPE trực tiếp trên Windows Vâng, sau khi tạo boot xong thì phần mềm có trên WinPE sẽ nằm trong thư mục này:\nApps\\ppApps trên ổ USB-DATA (với USB) hoặc HDD-DATA (với ổ cứng rời HDD/SSD).\nVậy nên, bạn chỉ cần truy cập theo đường dẫn đó =\u003e nhấp phải chuột lên file Windows.exe và chọn Run as administrator =\u003e rồi chọn phần mềm cần sử dụng.\n#3. Cách tích hợp công cụ Anhdv Boot vào ổ cứng Để tiện hơn cho việc sử dụng thì bạn hoàn toàn có thể tích hợp bộ công cụ cứu hộ vào ổ cứng máy tính.\n#4. Cách tự động kết nối WiFi trên WinPE Bạn có thể dễ dàng trích xuất danh sách mạng WiFi đã từng kết nối trên máy tính để truy cập nhanh trên WinPE.\n#5. Cách ẩn/hiện phân vùng Boot ẩn Cách 1: Bạn chạy công cụ 1Click của Anhdv Boot =\u003e sau khi chọn ngôn ngữ xong thì bạn sử dụng tùy chọn số [3] để ẩn/ hiện nhanh phân vùng Boot của USB/HDD..\nCách 2. Sử dụng công cụ BOOTICE trong thư mục Tools =\u003e rồi làm như hình bên dưới, hoặc xem bài hướng dẫn chi tiết này !\n#6. Một vài chia sẻ thêm +) Nếu vào WinPE (Mini Windows) mà bị màn hình đen (chỉ xuất hiện con trỏ chuột) thì bạn hãy nhấn tổ hợp phím Ctrl + Shift + F5 nhé.\n+) Trên rất nhiều bài viết về cách tạo USB BOOT thì minh thấy nhiều bạn có nhu cầu tích hợp bộ cài Win vào USB.\nCó nghĩa là cài Win trực tiếp từ màn hình boot, mà không cần truy cập vào WinPE.\nTuy nhiên, với kinh nghiệm của mình thì mình khuyên các bạn nên truy cập vào Mini Windows (WinPE) =\u003e sau đó mới thực hiện cài Win trong Mini Win.\nLý dó là:\n1) Bạn sẽ ít bị cài nhầm ổ hơn và khả năng bị lỗi cũng ít hơn.\n2) Các dòng Laptop đời mới hiện nay đều mặc định kích hoạt Bitlocker, vậy nên khi vào WinPE thì bạn mới phát hiện ra được (có ổ khóa màu vàng ở phân vùng ổ cứng) để mà còn tắt.\n(không tắt mà xoá Windows, không có khoá recovery, không đăng nhập tài khoản microsoft là “bay màu” dữ liệu)\nIV. Lời kết Vâng, như vậy là mình vừa hướng dẫn xong cho bạn cách tạo USB BOOT với Anhdv Boot 2022 rồi nhé.\nBản boot này có khá nhiều cải tiến so với bản 2021 trước đó. Vậy nên, nếu bạn yêu thích các bạn boot thì hãy trải nghiệm ngay và luôn đi nhé 🙂\nKiên Nguyễn – Blogchiasekienthuc.com\n",

Sau đó, nó sẽ được xuất bản dưới dạng một ghi chú độc lập, chỉ hiển thị bản rút tiền.\nĐánh dấu nhiều ghi chú bằng dg-publish Bản thân plugin không cung cấp bất kỳ cách dễ dàng nào để đánh dấu nhiều ghi chú cùng một lúc bằng thuộc tính dg-publish. Tuy nhiên, bạn có thể sử dụng plugin như MetaEdit có nhiều tính năng được thiết kế cho mục đích này.\nTự động thêm cờ xuất bản cần ghi chú khi thêm ghi chú vào thư mục Một số người đã yêu cầu chức năng xuất bản tất cả các ghi chú trong một thư mục nhất định.

    "content": "GitHub có lẽ là một trong những nền tảng nổi tiếng nhất trong cộng đồng dev, một trong những nền tảng được sử dụng nhiều nhất (nằm ngay bên cạnh những nền tảng khác như Stackoverflow). Nó cho phép công khai các dự án của bạn, quản lý chúng và thậm chí tìm những người khác để giúp đỡ về những nỗ lực nguồn mở của họ. Một điều chúng ta thường không thực sự chú ý là khả năng tích hợp vào các hệ thống khác của nó. Đúng vậy, GitHub không chỉ là nơi bạn đặt các dự án của mình cho người khác xem, nó có thể đóng vai trò là bước đệm cho rất nhiều nền tảng và hệ thống khác ngoài đó và trong bài viết này, tôi sẽ giới thiệu cho bạn. Đâu là những tích hợp hàng đầu với GitHub bạn có thể tìm thấy (và có thể sử dụng là tốt).\n1. IDE integration Mọi nhà phát triển đều cần cho mình 1 IDE hay Text Editor, bạn sẽ không thể lập trình nếu như thiếu nó. Vậy hãy bắt đầu với những tích hợp trong IDE Sẽ có rất nhiều IDE, Text editor ngoài kia, tùy thuộc vào ngôn ngữ lập trình của bạn, nhưng một số IDE phổ biến nhất có khả năng bao gồm các plugin hoặc tiện ích mở rộng và do đó người dùng đã quyết định thêm một số tính năng tích hợp với GitHub\nVSCode Bỏ qua rất nhiều tiện ích mở rộng chỉ tương thích với Git, có một số tiện ích cho phép bạn giao tiếp với GitHub’s PR Api, chẳng hạn như: GitHub Pull Requests\nTiện ích mở rộng này cho phép bạn xem xét và quản lý PR của bạn ngay tại đó, từ bên trong IDE. Nếu bạn đang chạy các dự án có khối lượng PR lớn, đây có thể là một lựa chọn thú vị để xem xét.\nSublime Text Đây là một trong những Text editor rất phổ biến trước VSCode và tôi nghĩ nhiều người vẫn sử dụng nó.\nVà như trước đây, có rất nhiều plugin dành riêng cho git mà bạn có thể sử dụng, nhưng thứ tôi muốn giới thiệu là: sublime-github\nĐiều này cho phép bạn truy cập vào các tính năng như mở một gist direclty trên cửa sổ soạn thảo hoặc tạo một gist mới từ mã bạn đã chọn. Rất hữu ích cho các hành động nhanh chóng và dễ dàng mà thông qua plugin này có thể giúp bạn tiết kiệm rất nhiều thời gian.\nIntelliJ IDE cuối cùng tôi muốn trình bày là IntelliJ một IDE rất phổ biến khác tương thích với nhiều ngôn ngữ lập trình khác nhau.\nIDE này cung cấp nhiều tích hợp, tất cả những gì bạn cần làm là nhập thông tin tài khoản GitHub của bạn và sau đó bắt đầu tương tác với các tính năng khác nhau. Bạn có thể tạo hoặc sao chép các dự án, mở phiên bản của tệp trực tiếp trong GitHub (tức là nếu bạn đang làm việc trên một tệp cụ thể và cần kiểm tra phiên bản GitHub ban đầu, bạn có thể thực hiện bằng vài cú nhấp chuột) cũng như tạo gist directly trực tiếp từ IDE.\n2. Issue tracker Một tính năng thú vị khác mà GitHub cung cấp, là khả năng xử lý các issue của dự án bằng API của họ, có nghĩa là có một số tùy chọn ngoài giúp bạn có thể sử dụng để mở rộng khái niệm và có trình theo dõi issue trên GitHub.\nGitKraken Glo Boards Đây có lẽ là một trong những nền tảng tốt nhất hoạt động dựa trên các issue GitHub và mở rộng các tính năng của nó.\nVới Glo Boards, bạn không chỉ có thể hình dung các vấn đề trên bảng kanban, bạn còn có thể trực tiếp lên lịch cho chúng bằng giao diện người dùng rất trực quan bằng cách kéo và thả các issue vào lịch.\nNếu bạn đang cố gắng xử lý một nhóm (đặc biệt là bây giờ với nhu cầu cao về kỹ năng quản lý nhóm từ xa) thì tùy chọn này là một cách đơn giản và mạnh mẽ để sắp xếp công việc cần thực hiện.\n3. Bots Bit.dev (BitDevBot) Bit.dev là một trung tâm component đám mây phổ biến. Nó là nơi để xuất bản, tài liệu và sắp xếp các thành phần JS (React, Angular, Vue, v.v.)\nBằng việc sử dụng Bit, các thành phần riêng lẻ có thể được xuất bản từ bất kỳ kho lưu trữ / cơ sở mã nào. Điều đó có nghĩa là nó không chỉ là một công cụ để xây dựng các hệ thống thiết kế mà còn là một công cụ để hợp tác thành phần.\nBit gần đây đã ra mắt với BitDevBot mới, bot Github tự động hóa các yêu cầu PR vào kho lưu trữ với các thành phần được import. Vì vậy, bất cứ khi nào một thành phần được cập nhật, tất cả các kho lưu trữ có liên quan đều được nhắc hợp nhất các thay đổi mới. Đây không chỉ là một cách để đảm bảo người dùng của các thành phần không bao giờ bỏ lỡ các bản cập nhật quan trọng mà còn là cách để nhận các bản cập nhật thành phần trong khi vẫn giữ các thay đổi cục bộ được thực hiện cho một thành phần trong một dự án cụ thể.\nSlack Một nền tảng rất phổ biến cho loại tương tác này là Slack, sau tất cả, nhiều công ty có xu hướng sử dụng các slack rooms để nhân viên của họ trò chuyện với nhau và chia sẻ thông tin dựa trên chủ đề của từng phòng.\nCác nhà phát triển từ GitHub đã phát hành một tích hợp với Slack, cho phép bạn xem chi tiết từ một repo dựa trên một liên kết duy nhất, đăng ký vào một kho lưu trữ với một lệnh duy nhất hoặc quản lý các vấn đề như thể bạn đang có một cuộc trò chuyện với đồng nghiệp.\n4. Continuous Integration Khi nói đến các giải pháp tích hợp liên tục, thị trường có một số tùy chọn tuyệt vời và hầu hết tất cả chúng đều có một số loại tích hợp với GitHub.\nCircle CI CI / CD này tích hợp với GitHub cho phép bạn giám sát các pipelines của chúng trực tiếp từ bên trong UI GitHub. Bạn có thể tìm thấy sự tích hợp trực tiếp trong GitHub’s marketplace..\nTravisCI Một tùy chọn khác cho một nền tảng tích hợp và triển khai liên tục là TravisCI.\nNếu nhóm của bạn đang sử dụng GitHub cho nền tảng kiểm soát phiên bản chính của họ, việc tích hợp nó vào một pipeline TravisCI và tự động hóa toàn bộ quá trình tích hợp \u0026 triển khai cũng dễ dàng như nhấp vào một vài liên kết.\n5. Vulnerability Đôi khi có ai đó trong nhóm của bạn kiểm tra mã của bạn để biết các lỗ hổng bảo mật từng tồn tại hoặc thậm chí các mô hình có thể bị khai thác. May mắn cho bạn, có một số tùy chọn tích hợp với nền tảng kiểm soát phiên bản yêu thích của chúng ta.\nLGTM Tương thích với sáu ngôn ngữ lập trình khác nhau (bao gồm JavaScript và Python), công cụ này sẽ tự động kiểm tra mã của bạn để tìm hơn 1600 lỗ hổng tiềm năng khác nhau trước khi chúng được sản xuất.\nPrisma Cloud Thay vì tập trung vào các nhà phát triển, việc tích hợp này dành cho các nhà phát triển, để giúp họ kiểm tra các lỗ hổng trên các tệp cấu hình của họ.\nChẳng hạn, nó sẽ tìm kiếm những thứ như AWS CloudFormation Templates, HashiCorp Terraform templates, v.v. và quét chúng để kiểm tra các khiếm khuyết tiềm ẩn. Đây là điều bắt buộc, đặc biệt nếu bạn đang cố gắng tự động hóa toàn bộ quá trình triển khai thông qua GitHub và bất kỳ nền tảng triển khai nào tích hợp với nó.\n6. Code review GitHub đã có một số tính năng review code đi kèm, đặc biệt là một phần của giao diện PR.\nĐiều đó đang được nói, không có gì sai khi tích hợp một số ứng dụng có thể tự động hóa quy trình và ít nhất, kiểm tra mã của bạn để biết các vấn đề rõ ràng và reviewer rảnh hơn để xem xét mã của bạn và tìm các vấn đề thực sự có liên quan (chẳng hạn như các vấn đề với logic dự định cho chức năng).\nMột ứng dụng như vậy là DeepSource, giúp phân tích mã của bạn và kiểm tra một số vấn đề tiềm ẩn, nhưng không giống như LGTM và Prisma Cloud, những vấn đề này có liên quan đến lỗi tiềm ẩn, vấn đề về hiệu suất và các vấn đề khác. Họ thậm chí còn đi xa đến mức tự động tạo ra các vấn đề cho các issue của bạn và đề xuất giải pháp cho một số vấn đề đó.\n7. Dependency management Quản lý phụ thuộc là một phần lớn trong các nhiệm vụ hàng ngày của chúng ta với tư cách là nhà phát triển, cho dù chúng ta nhận ra hay không. Người ta phát minh ra chiếc bánh xe, và bạn sử dụng nó, nhưng bạn có chắc rằng bánh xe đó tốt và tốt ưu nhất?\nKhông ai có thể nói rằng chúng ta có thể tin tưởng chủ sở hữu của những Dependency? Ai nói rằng mã là hoàn hảo và không có lỗi hoặc vấn đề hiệu suất? Mặc dù không phải là ngôn ngữ duy nhất có, nhưng ở đây tôi sẽ nói về Node.js và đây là một sự tích hợp mà bạn có thể quan tâm: DepChecker-Bot\nNó sẽ phân tích sự phụ thuộc npm của bạn và đưa ra cảnh báo về những điều nguy hiểm tiềm tàng.\n8. Heroku Sự tích hợp cuối cùng với GitHub mà tôi muốn đề cập, đó là Heroku, nền tảng này cho phép bạn triển khai và chạy ứng dụng của mình mà không phải lo lắng về bất kỳ loại cơ sở hạ tầng hoặc tập lệnh triển khai tùy chỉnh nào.\nHeroku sẽ lo tất cả mọi thứ cho bạn và với sự tích hợp này, bạn có thể tự động hóa các nhánh hợp nhất thành công để triển khai hoặc thậm chí có các ứng dụng đánh giá, được biên dịch từ mỗi PR nhận được để bạn kiểm tra thủ công trong trường hợp đó là một phần của quy trình triển khai của bạn.\nNguồn: https://blog.bitsrc.io/\n",

Các bạn lưu ý nhé !\n#1. Cần chuẩn bị những gì? Đầu tiên bạn hãy tạo một chiếc USB boot đa năng. File *.ISO Windows (Win gì thì tùy bạn). Bạn có thể tải các bộ Windows Setup nguyên gốc về tại đây. Chỉ đơn giản là như vậy thôi, các công cụ cần thiết thì đã có sẵn trong chiếc usb boot mà bạn đã tạo trước đó rồi.\n#2. Cách cài Win trên môi trường WinPE Update thêm 1 cách hay: Trong môi trường WinPE (Mini Windows) thì ngoài cách bên dưới ra thì bạn có thể thực hiện cài Win một cách cực kỳ nhanh chóng đó là:\n+ Bước 1: Truy cập vào Mini Windows.\n+ Bước 2: Mount file cài đặt Windows ra ổ đĩa ảo bằng cách nhấn chuột phải vào file iso đó =\u003e chọn Mount as ImDisk Virtual Disk.\n+ Bước 3: Mở ổ đĩa ảo mà bạn vừa Mount ra =\u003e chạy file setup.exe =\u003e và bắt đầu quá trình cài Win.\nXem bài viết chi tiết: Cách cài Windows chuẩn Legacy/UEFI bằng file Setup.exe\nHoặc là làm theo các cách bên dưới:\nBạn hãy cắm USB BOOT vào máy tính và boot vào môi trường Mini Windows (Mini Windows 7, 8, 10 hoặc 11 đều được.)\n+ Bước 1: Vào Computer =\u003e và Format phân vùng ổ cứng mà bạn muốn cài Windows (trong phần File Type =\u003e bạn nhớ chọn là NTFS nhé).\nBạn nên bỏ dấu tích tại ô kiểm Quick Format trước khi tiến hành Format ổ cứng nhé, chúng ta sẽ format ổ cứng ở chế độ bình thường sẽ tốt hơn.\n**TIPs:\n**Ngoài các trên ra thì bạn có thể sử dung phần mềm Partition Wizard để Delete phân vùng mà bạn muốn cài Win lên cũng được nhé.\nBạn đợi một lát để máy tính Format nhé, cũng phải mất một lúc đó vì chúng ta đã bỏ chế độ Format nhanh mà. Sau khi xong thì chuyển sang bước tiếp theo.\n+ Bước 2: Nhấp chuột vào biểu tượng DLC BOOT =\u003e chọn Disk Tools =\u003e chọn công cụ BootICE.\nTiếp theo chúng ta sẽ thiết lập để nạp MBR, PBR cho phân vùng ổ cứng mà chúng ta vừa Format:\nChọn Physical =\u003e chọn đúng phân vùng bạn vừa Format lúc nãy =\u003e nhấn vào Process MBR =\u003e chọn Windows NT 5.x/ 6.xMBR =\u003e chọn Install/ Config. Bạn làm lần lượt như hình bên dưới nhé:\nLựa chọn phiên bản mới nhất mà dùng nhé.\nTiếp tục nhấn vào Process MBR =\u003e chọn đúng phân vùng ổ cứng mà bạn vừa Format =\u003e chọn Install/ Config và nhấn OK để cài đặt.\nBạn thiết lập như hình bên dưới nhé.\n+ Bước 3: Bước này chúng ta sẽ có 2 cách để cài đặt đó là “Mount” ra ổ đĩa ảo để cài đặt trực tiếp với file setup.exe có trong bộ cài, còn cách thứ 2 chúng ta sẽ sử dụng công cụ WinNTsetup có trong USB BOOT.\n+ Cách 1: Mount file setup Windows ra ổ đĩa ảo bằng cách nhấp chuột phải vào file *.iso đó =\u003e và chọn Mount as ImDisk Virtual Disk.\nLúc này nó sẽ tự động tạo cho chúng ta một ổ đĩa ảo chứa bộ cài Windows trong đó.\nSau đó bạn tiến hành cài đặt như bình thường, bạn có thể tham khảo bài viết cách cài Windows nếu như chưa biết nhé.\nHướng dẫn cách cài đặt Windows 10 (32bit và 64bit) chi tiết Hướng dẫn cách cài Windows 7 chi tiết bằng hình ảnh Hướng dẫn cách cài Windows 8/8.1chi tiết bằng hình ảnh #3. Cách sử dụng WinNTsetup để cài Windows + Cách 2: Sử dụng công cụ WinNTsetup để cài đặt. Để làm được việc này đầu tiên các bạn nhấn cũng Mount file iso ra ổ đĩa ảo như hướng dẫn ở cách 1.\nSau đó nhấn vào biểu tượng DLC BOOT =\u003e chọn System =\u003e mở phần mềm WinNTSetup lên như hình dưới đây:\nTại giao diện chính của WinNTsetup bạn thiết lập như hướng dẫn sau đây. Chọn Windows Vista/7/8/2008/2012 nếu như bạn đang cài Windows 7 trở lên.\nTiếp theo tại khung Select location of the install.wim file =\u003e bạn nhấn vào Search để tìm đến file install.wim hoặc là install.esd trong ổ đĩa ảo bạn đã Burn lúc nãy.\nLưu ý quan trọng:\nPhải có 3 dấu tích xanh như trong khung đỏ mình đã khoanh lại thì mới được nhé, còn nếu như có dấu chấm than vàng hay dấu x đỏ thì tỷ lệ lỗi sẽ cao hơn.\nNếu như làm lần lượt các bước như hướng dẫn bên trên mình đảm bảo không bị lỗi tại đây.\nBạn làm như hình bên dưới để mở file install.wim (file install.wim hoặc là install.esd nằm trong Folder sources nhé )\nBạn thiết lập tiếp như sau:\nTại khung Select localtion of the installation driver =\u003e bạn nhấn vào Search.. =\u003e và chọn đúng phân vùng mà bạn muốn cài win nhé.\nTích vào ô kiểm Patch UxTheme.dll to allow unsigned Themes Tweaks: Thiếp lập tùy chọn nâng cao nếu bạn muốn (trong này có khá nhiều tính năng hay bạn có thể vào để xem, nếu không hiểu thì có thể sử dụng google dịch nhé :D) Setup: Bắt đầu quá trình cài đặt Windows. Ngoài ra, tại phần Option Edition bạn có thể chọn hệ điều hành Windows mà bạn đang thực hiện cài đặt. Lưu ý:\nKhi bạn nhấn là Setup thì sẽ có một thông báo hỏi bạn muốn chọn chế độ khởi động bằng BootICE hay là chế độ khác ở phần Boot Menu.\nỞ phiên bản cũ mình đang dùng thì chỉ có một lựa chọn là BootICE nhưng ở những phiên bản WinNTsetup mới hơn thì có thêm lựa chọn là BootSect (tức là mặc định của Windows Setup). Khuyến khích các bạn nên lựa chọn chế độ BootICE nhé.\nOK, giờ thì tranh thủ ra làm tách càfe trong lúc chờ đợi phần mềm bắt đầu quá trình cài đặt Win. Sau khi xong nó sẽ hiện lên thông báo như hình bên dưới. Bạn nhấn OK và khởi động lại máy tính để hoàn tất nốt quá trình cài Win.\n____________\nCác bạn có thể tham khảo video hướng dẫn cách cài Win chuẩn LEGACY bằng WinNTSetup sau đây:\n// Trong video có sử dụng bộ công cụ cứu hộ NHV BOOT, bạn có thể sử dụng bộ cứu hộ khác cũng được nhé, cách làm hoàn toàn tương tự.\nHiện tại mình đã mở cửa Blog Chia Sẻ Kiến Thức Store ! – bán phần mềm trả phí với mức giá siêu rẻ – chỉ từ 180.000đ (bản quyền vĩnh viễn Windows 10/11, Office 365, 2021, 2016… và nhiều phần mềm bản quyền khác). Bảo hành full thời gian sử dụng nhé !\n#3. Lời kết Như vậy là đã xong phần hướng dẫn cài Windows trong môi trường WinPE rồi nhé, hướng dẫn thì dài dòng vậy thôi chứ thao tác thì nhanh cực kỳ luôn.\nHi vọng phương pháp cài win mới này sẽ giúp ích cho bạn trong việc cứu hộ máy tính, ngoài cách này ra để cài windows cho máy tính thì bạn có thể tham khảo các cách khác tại đây. Chúc các bạn thành công !\nKiên Nguyễn – Blogchiasekienthuc.com\n",

Cách này giúp bạn tạo usb boot vừa cài Win trực tiếp, lại vừa có đầy đủ công cụ cứu hộ của Anhdv Boot. Đương nhiên, cách tích hợp bộ cài Windows này hỗ trợ cả 2 chuẩn UEFI – Legacy.\nNếu sử dụng Anhdv Boot 2020 thì bạn có thể tích hợp nhiều bộ cài windows dạng ISO rất dễ dàng theo hướng dẫn này.\nTạo USB cài Win thuần (ví dụ WinToUSB) có ưu điểm là dễ làm. Nhưng bạn sẽ đồng ý quan điểm với mình rằng làm thế sẽ rất lãng phí. Lý do là usb đó chỉ dùng để cài file ISO Win nhất định. Muốn cài bản Windows khác bạn lại phải tạo lại usb boot. Hay muốn Ghost Win, cứu dữ liệu, sửa lỗi màn hình xanh … thì làm thế nào?\nSử dụng Anhdv Boot sẽ giúp bạn có usb boot đa năng vừa dùng để cài nhiều bản Win, lại vừa có đầy đủ công cụ cứu hộ. Anhdv Boot sẽ trở nên đa năng hơn nữa khi được tích hợp bộ cài Win.\nƯu điểm khi tích hợp bộ cài Win vào USB cứu hộ Anhdv Boot\nGiúp cài đặt Windows trực tiếp từ menu của USB Anhdv Boot. Hỗ trợ tính năng Repair Windows Vẫn dùng đầy đủ công cụ cứu hộ của Anhdv Boot (Mini Windows 10, 8, 7, XP, và các phần mềm khác) Hỗ trợ cài đặt Windows theo cả 2 chuẩn UEFI – GPT và Legacy – MBR. Nhược điểm của cách này là tích hợp được 01 bộ cài Windows và khó thực hiện. Cách tối ưu nhất vẫn là cài đặt Windows từ Mini Windows 10, tức muốn cài Win nào thì copy file iso bộ cài vào usb.\nĐọc thêm\nTìm hiểu về Anhdv Boot 2018 Hướng dẫn cài đặt Windows từ Mini Windows 10 (Win10PE) Hướng dẫn tích hợp bộ cài Win vào usb Anhdv Boot Bước 1: Tạo usb cứu hộ Andv Boot hỗ trợ cả 2 chuẩn UEFI – Legacy Việc tạo usb boot cứu hộ Anhdv Boot rất đơn giản với chỉ 1 click chuột: tạo usb boot cứu hộ đa năng với 1 click. Nếu USB từ 8GB trở lên, thì bạn nên lựa chọn tạo usb boot với phân vùng ẩn nhé.\nBước 2: Chạy lại công cụ 1 click Anhdv Boot để hiện phân vùng usb boot ẩn Sau khi tạo usb boot xong, bạn sẽ nhận được thông báo:\nViệc cần làm là ngắt usb ra và cắm lại, sau đó chạy lại công cụ 1 click Anhdv Boot.

Bấm Easy mode để thêm menu boot bộ cài Win. Riêng với Anhdv Boot 2020 trở lên thì file BCD hiện đổi thành WIN.\nSửa file BCD legacy\nBấm Add \u003e New WIM boot entry\nLần lượt làm các bước như hình trên\nMục số 1: Lựa chọn USB. Mục số 2: Lựa chọn phân vùng USB-DATA (nếu tạo usb boot phân vùng ẩn). Còn không thì USB chỉ có 1 phân vùng USB-BOOT. Mục số 3 và 5: Cần nhập đúng như hình trên (nhớ là Winload.exe với Legacy) Mục số 4: Tên của Menu boot (bạn có thể thay đổi theo ý mình). Sau khi lưu ở mục số 6, 7 thì bấm Close để thoát Nếu bạn thêm Windows AIO Anhdv thì cần thay đổi đường dẫn ở mục File như mục số 4 (\\x64\\sources\\boot.wim). Để cài windows 32 bit trong aio thì thêm tiếp Menu với mục File là \\x86\\sources\\boot.wim.\nSửa file BCD UEFI\nMở file BCD theo đường dẫn X:\\efi\\Microsoft\\Boot\\BCD của USB.\nChọn Easy mode\nBấm Add \u003e New WIM boot entry\nMục số 1: Lựa chọn USB Mục số 2: Chọn phân vùng NTFS USB-DATA Mục số 3 và 5: Nhập đúng như hình trên (với winload.efi cho Windows UEFI) Mục số 4: Tên của Menu boot, bạn có thể thay đổi theo ý mình. Như vậy là quá trình tạo Menu tích hợp bộ cài Windows vào usb boot đã hoàn tất. Bạn có thể chạy Qemu (có trong file tải về của Anhdv Boot) để thử xem tạo usb boot cài Win thành công hay chưa.\nBước 4: Copy bộ cài Windows vào USB Anhdv Boot Nếu chưa có bộ cài Windows thì tham khảo một số bộ cài mình làm sẵn ở dưới đây\nWindows 10 Version 20H2 AIO 2in 1 siêu mượt by anhdv Tải về bộ cài Windows 10 LTSC 2019 by anhdv Tải về Windows 7 SP1 cập nhật mới nhất và tích hợp sẵn driver sata, usb 3.0 Trước khi copy bộ cài Win vào USB thì cần phải kiểm tra tính toàn vẹn của file theo hướng dẫn này. Khi cài đặt Windows 7 thì bạn cũng cần tải sẵn driver từ trang chủ laptop hay mainboard.\nNhấp đúp (với win 10, 8.1) vào file ISO của bộ cài đặt Windows cần tích hợp. Với Windows 7 hay XP thì bạn có thể sử dụng phần mềm ổ ảo hay 7zip, Winrar. Copy (hay trích xuất) thư mục sources của bộ cài tới phân vùng USB-DATA. Tức bạn nhấp phải vào thư mục sources rồi chọn send to tới phân vùng usb-data.\nNếu dùng Windows AIO anhdv thì mở file iso aio lên và copy 2 thư mục x64 và x86 vào USB.\nKhi việc Copy hoàn tất thì quay trở lại cửa sổ công cụ 1 click Anhdv boot, nhập số 3 để ẩn lại phân vùng USB-BOOT\nKhi cài Win trực tiếp từ Anhdv Boot thì chọn Boot Mini Windows \u003e Install Windows ….\nĐọc thêm: Hướng dẫn chi tiết các cài Win 10 mới nhất\nKết luận Trên đây mình đã hướng dẫn cách tích hợp bộ cài Win vào usb cứu hộ Anhdv Boot. Nếu muốn tích hợp bộ cài AIO của anh-dv.com vào thì bạn có thể tạo hai folder x64 và x86 ở USB-DATA. Sau đó lần lượt copy thư mục sources trong x64 và x86 của AIo vào hai mục vừa tạo tương ứng trên USB. Hoặc để nhanh thì copy luôn 2 folder x64 và x86 trong AIO anhdv vào phân vùng USB-DATA. Tại mục File thì cần chỉnh lại thành \\x64\\sources\\boot.wim. Và tạo thêm menu cài win AIO 32 bit với đường dẫn \\x86\\sources\\boot.wim.\nBạn có thể Like Fanpage để nhận được thông tin sớm nhất về các bộ cài Windows khác. Chúc thành công!\n",

    "content": "Bạn có cảm thấy việc đi tìm xem máy tính thiếu driver nào, driver nào đã cũ cần cập nhật là quá nhàm chán và mệt mỏi không? Nào là driver mạng, driver âm thanh, driver USB, driver màn hình, rất nhiều loại driver mà chỉ nhìn thôi cũng đủ hoa mắt rồi. Chưa kể là việc tìm đúng driver để cài cho máy cũng chả dễ dàng gì.\nBạn mình có con Acer Aspire E15, cài Windows 8.1 64 bit mà mất mấy tháng giời không tìm được driver WiFi cho máy, đi đâu cũng phải kéo lê theo đoạn dây mạng, nhìn đến khổ. Hỏi nó là máy không bắt được WiFi à, nó bảo lên cả trang chủ Acer tải về rồi, cài rồi mà chả ăn thua, cài xong vẫn không thấy tí dấu hiệu WiFi nào. Nó cũng lần mò tìm cả Driver Easy về rồi, nhưng khổ thằng đó mất phí khi cần cập nhật hàng loạt, tốc độ tải thì siêu chậm, cứ nhấp một nút nó lại hỏi có nâng cấp lên bản Pro không, mà giao diện sau khi hỏi nâng cấp thì rất loạn chả biết bấm vào đâu, khiến nó phát rồ, bỏ cuộc và sống chung với cái dây mạng.\nMình bảo nó thử Driver Booster xem sao, nó cài thử, xong một lúc thấy chat bảo ngon rồi, “oai phai” chạy ầm ầm. Thiết nghĩ nhiều người không chuyên về máy tính hẳn cũng sẽ gặp những khó khăn tương tự khi đối mặt với vấn đề tìm, cập nhật hay tải và cài đặt driver nên mình viết bài này, hy vọng giúp các bạn gỡ rối được phần nào.\nTham khảo thêm:\n2 cách đơn giản cập nhật driver VGA cho màn hình máy tính, laptop Bạn có thể thắc mắc sao không dùng bản Driver Easy crack, câu trả lời là việc crack đối với một số người còn khó khăn hơn cả tải driver. Vì thế mình đưa ra lựa chọn này là hướng đến người dùng bình thường như thế thôi nhé.\nCác bước cập nhật driver bằng Driver Booster cho máy tính như sau Bước 1: Tải Driver Booster\nNhấp vào đây để tải Driver Booster\nBước 2: Cài đặt Driver Booster\nVề cơ bản chỉ cần nhấp đúp vào tập tin thực thi và nhấn Next để cài đặt, nhưng có một lưu ý nhỏ cho các bạn là cần đọc kỹ những gì đang hiện ra trên màn hình. Vì là ứng dụng miễn phí nên Driver Booster sẽ hỏi để cài thêm một công cụ khác (của công ty chủ quản hoặc đối tác để kiếm thêm) vào máy tính của bạn, đến màn hình đó hãy nhấn vào nút nào mang ý là từ chối.\nChọn Custom Install để tùy chỉnh trong quá trình cài đặt:\nXuất hiện màn hình có chữ “Recommended by IObit” như này bạn chọn No, thanks để không cài thêm phần mềm khác vào máy tính:\nKhi kết thúc quá trình cài đặt IObit sẽ hỏi bạn xem có muốn nhận email thông báo thường xuyên về sản phẩm của hãng không, nếu bạn chỉ muốn cập nhật driver mà không quan tâm lắm đến vấn đề này thì chọn No, thanks để đỡ phải đọc mail.\nBước 3: Quét driver còn thiếu, đã cũ\nSau khi cài đặt xong, Driver Booster sẽ tự động quét máy tính của bạn để tìm xem máy còn thiếu driver nào, driver nào đã cũ, mức độ cũ là như thế nào.\nGiao diện Driver Booster khi quét driver:\nBước 4: Cập nhật driver, tải và cài đặt driver\nSau khi quét xong, ứng dụng sẽ trả về một danh sách các driver còn thiếu (missing) và đã cũ, bạn có thể tìm đến driver mình muốn cập nhật hoặc tải về rồi chọn Update/Install ở dòng tương ứng. Nhưng nhàn nhất là ấn Update Now ở ngay dòng thông báo có bao nhiêu driver cần cập nhật, ứng dụng sẽ tải về và cập nhật tất cả cho bạn.\nTrong quá trình cập nhật, đến driver của thằng nào thì thằng đó sẽ bị tạm dừng, ví dụ cập nhật driver âm thanh thì âm thanh sẽ bị gián đoạn 1 chút, cập nhật driver mạng thì mạng sẽ bị ngắt kết nối. Vì thế, bạn nên thực hiện cập nhật driver khi máy tính đang nhàn rỗi.\nDriver Booster đang tải gói driver về máy tính:\nTrên Windows 10, Driver Booster sẽ tạo điểm khôi phục trước khi tiến hành cập nhật driver cho máy tính.\nSau khi tạo điểm khôi phục, ứng dụng sẽ tiến hành cập nhật driver cho bạn. Với số lượng khoảng 15 driver, Driver Booster thực hiện công việc khá nhanh chóng, chắc chỉ đôi phút (tất nhiên tùy mạng và độ nặng của driver). Kết quả sẽ kiểu như này:\nBạn có thể phải khởi động lại máy tính để các bản cập nhật driver có hiệu lực. Driver Booster đã có bản 6, giao diện khá đẹp, và nhiều cập nhật quan trọng, đặc biệt là cho các tín đồ Windows 10 và game.\nTính năng mới của Driver Booster 6.0 Phiên bản mới nhất của Driver Booster mang đến những bản driver mới nhất:\nIntel Graphics Driver mới nhất cho Windows 10, giúp sửa lỗi driver trong game FIFA 19 cũng như tận hưởng những tiện ích mà Intel® UHD Graphics 620 mang lại. GeForce Game Ready 416.34 của NVIDIA để tối ưu hóa và sửa lỗi đồ họa cho hàng loạt game lớn như Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, GRIP và SOULCALIBUR VI. Radeon™ Software Adrenalin Edition của AMD hỗ trợ đầy đủ cho bản cập nhật mới nhất của Windows 10 và cải thiện hiệu suất của game Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, sửa lỗi và liệt kê những lỗi đã được phát hiện, bao gồm driver âm thah HDMI đôi khi không thể nâng cấp trong quá trình cài đặt Radeon Software. Bên cạnh việc cập nhật driver thông thường của Intel, NVIDIA và AMD, Driver Booster 6 Pro cũng có thể giúp cập nhật hơn 3.000.000 driver và khắc phục các sự cố liên quan đến driver. Ngoài ra, tính năng Game Boost cho phép bạn trải nghiệm hiệu năng chơi game cao hơn mà không bị các tác vụ chạy nền và dịch vụ Windows không cần thiết cản trở. Mình thích nhất ở ứng dụng này là dù miễn phí nhưng cho phép tải và cập nhật hàng loạt chỉ với một cú nhấp chuột, dù quét hay tải/cài đặt driver thì đều thực hiện rất nhanh chóng, mượt mà, không ngốn tài nguyên máy tính. Tất nhiên, với người dùng chuyên sâu thì sẽ thấy ứng dụng này không có gì đáng để ca ngợi, nhưng với người dùng bình thường thì Driver Booster thực sự là một cứu cánh rất tốt trong trường hợp phải dò tìm để cài, cập nhật driver cho máy tính.\nDriver Booster bản trả phí thì sao? Bạn sẽ phải trả 22,95$/1 năm/3 PC. Bạn có thể theo dõi các bài viết về Driver Booster Pro của Quantrimang.com để có cơ hội nhận được key phần mềm miễn phí nhé. Tặng key Driver Booster 6 Pro 6 tháng\nCác tính năng của phần mềmDriver Booster FreeDriver Booster PROCập nhật driver nhanh và an toàn hơnTự động quét, nhận diện các driver bị thiếu, lỗi thời, bị lỗi.vvCập nhật driver bị lỗi thời chỉ với 1 cú nhấp chuột.vvChỉ cung cấp những driver đã vượt qua các bài thử nghiệm Microsoft WHQL và IObit Review.vvCác gói driver được nén với dung lượng nhỏ hơn để tiết kiệm thời gian.vvCơ sở dữ liệu lớn hơn để cập nhật nhiều driver hiếm, cũ hơn.vMở khóa giới hạn tốc độ tải driver.vTự động sao lưu tất cả các driver để có thể khôi phục an toàn.vTự động tải, cài đặt và cập nhật driver trong thời gian máy tính nhàn rỗi.vDễ dàng sửa các lỗi thiết bị cho hiệu suất tốt hơn.vTrải nghiệm chơi game tốt hơnTăng hiệu suất chơi game bằng cách dừng những tiến trình không cần thiết.vvƯu tiên cập nhật Game Ready Driver để chơi game mượt và ngon hơn.vCải thiện trải nghiệm chơi game với các thành phần game cần thiết.vCác dịch vụ hỗ trợ của IobitTự động cập nhật lên phiên bản mới nhất.vvHỗ trợ kỹ thuật miễn phí 24/7 theo nhu cầuv\rNếu muốn máy tính tự động cập nhật driver định kỳ, bạn không phải “mó” tay vào thì thử dùng phần mềm SnailDriver xem sao nhé.

Các bước thực hiện như sau:\nTạo Obsidian vault là thư mục chứa các ghi chú của bạn trong iCloud folder (mở bằng Finder) Chọn Open folder as Vault trong Obsidian sau đó chọn thư mục bạn vừa tạo với iCloud để sử dụng. Bạn có thể lựa chọn sử dụng thư mục cấu hình sẵn Obsidian Go V3 mà tôi chia sẻ để bắt đầu nhanh. Chỉ cần giải nén file và copy toàn bộ thư mục được chia sẻ vào vị trí bạn muốn lưu trữ trong iCloud rồi Open folder as vault từ Obsidian để sử dụng.\nChọn thư mục lưu trữ ghi chú trong Obsidian. Open as Vault\nWindows/Linux¶ Bạn có thể sử dụng dịch vụ OneDrive được tích hợp sẵn vào hệ điều hành Windows để đồng bộ dữ liệu. Các bước thực hiện đồng bộ tương tự như với macOS, trong trường hợp này nơi lưu trữ thư mục Obsidian là OneDrive thay vì iCloud. Tải OneDrive để cài đặt tại đây.\nNếu bạn sử dụng Google Drive hay để đồng bộ dữ liệu thì sẽ cần cài ứng dụng Google Drive trên máy tính của mình, các bước thực hiện tương tự như Onedrive và iCloud.\nĐồng bộ thiết bị di động với đám mây¶ iPhone/iPad¶ Cài đặt Obsidian trên iPhone/iPad và mở thư mục Obsidian từ bộ nhớ iCloud trên máy để sử dụng.\nAndroid¶ Bạn có thể chọn một ứng dụng của bên thứ 3 như:\nFolder Sync cho phép sử dụng miễn phí kèm quảng cáo hoặc trả phí với giá phải chăng (~100K) Drop Sync. Các dịch vụ như OneDrive, Google Drive, vv không hỗ trợ đồng bộ dữ liệu theo một thư mục cụ thể trên thiết bị di động, do đó bạn cần dùng dịch vụ của bên thứ 3 như trên.\nDưới đây là video tôi hướng dẫn cụ thể cách thiết lập đồng bộ Folder Sync với Onedrive.\n",

    "content": "Bài viết này thuộc phần 1 của 14 phần trong series Học cài win\nĐây là bài mở đầu trong serie bài viết về học cài win, tôi sẽ cũng cấp cho các bạn những thông tin cơ bản nhất về cài Win. Cũng tại đây, bạn sẽ biết mình cần phải chuẩn bị những gì trước khi bắt tay vào việc cài win cho máy tính.\nHệ điều hành là một phần mềm chạy trên máy tính, dùng để điều hành, quản lý các thiết bị phần cứng và phần mềm ứng dụng khác. Hệ điều hành là cầu nối giữa người sử dụng và phần cứng máy tính, cung cấp nền tảng đề cài đặt các ứng dụng. Hệ điều hành được dùng phổ biến nhất hiện nay là Windows (Win). Cài Win có nghĩa là cài đặt hệ điều hành windows lên máy tính.\nChúng ta cài win khi:\nKhi mua máy tính mới không được cài sẵn hệ điều hành Windows (FreeDos, Ubuntu … chẳng hạn). Khi máy tính bị lỗi Win mà không thể khắc phục được. Khi cần cài nhiều Windows trên cùng một máy tính. Hoặc đơn giản là tự mày mò để học cách cài win như mục tiêu của các loạt bài viết này chẳng hạn. Cần chuẩn bị những gì trước khi học cài Win? Bạn cần phải biết cách vào BIOS và Boot Options của máy tính. Vào BIOS để thiết lập cài Win theo chuẩn UEFI hay Legacy, đặt ưu tiên khởi động từ USB, HDD, DVD cho máy tính …. Vào Boot Options để chọn khởi động vào USB, HDD, DVD Tìm hiểu xem máy tính định cài Win sử dụng chuẩn UEFI hay Legacy. Chuẩn bị bộ cài Windows, nên dùng bộ cài từ Microsoft hoặc rõ nguồn gốc. Kiểm tra tính toàn vẹn của file bộ cài win là việc cần phải làm. Tùy theo cấu hình máy tính mà lựa chọn cài phiên bản Windows cho phù hợp. Nếu gặp khó khăn trong vấn đề lựa chọn phiên bản Win, bạn có thể để lại bình luận để mình trợ giúp nhé.\nTải về Windows 10 mới nhất\nTải về bộ cài Windows được cập nhật mới nhất hàng tháng\nTải về Windows AIO 10, 8, 7 trong một ISO\nTải về Windows 7 tích hợp sẵn driver usb 3.0\nChuẩn bị driver (trình điều khiển phần cứng máy tính), đặc biệt là với Windows 7 thì là bắt buộc. Bởi vì cài xong Windows 7, bạn có thể không vào được mạng. Driver thì tốt nhất là tải về từ trang chủ laptop hay mainboard. Từ khóa tìm kiếm ví dụ có thể là “HP 8470P Driver support” chẳng hạn. Nếu máy tính bạn không hỗ trợ driver Win 7 thì không nên cố cài Win 7 lên máy, nên dùng Windows 8.1, 10.\nTrang tìm driver HP\nTrang tìm driver Dell\nTrang tìm driver Lenovo\nTrang tìm drievr Asus Chuẩn bị công cụ hỗ trợ cài Win (USB, DVD, phần mềm hỗ trợ) Biết cách phân chia ổ cứng trước khi cài win Khi cài Win bạn cũng nên nắm một số điều cơ bản sau:\nĐọc thêm: Những lỗi cài Win hay gặp\nVới máy tính RAM \u003c 4GB thì nên cài Windows 32 bit, máy tính RAM từ 4GB trở nên thì dùng Windows 64 bit. Đương nhiên, chọn cài Windows 32 hay 64 bit thì cần tải bộ cài Win tương ứng. Để cài đặt Windows UEFI thì phải boot USB hay DVD ở chế độ UEFI. Để cài Win Legacy phải boot USB hay DVD ở chế độ Legacy. Có những cách cài win nào? Học cài win bằng đĩa CD/DVD Ưu điểm\nƯu điểm của cách cài win bằng đĩa CD/DVD là cách thực hiện rất đơn giản. Bạn chỉ cần dùng đĩa DVD Windows (đĩa bản quyền, hoặc đĩa mua từ cửa hàng máy tính) và vào Boot options để chọn khởi động từ DVD.\nNhược điểm\nMáy tính của bạn cần phải có ổ đĩa DVD và cách cài Win này sẽ chậm hơn so với cài từ USB hay ổ cứng.\nHọc cài win bằng USB Ưu điểm\nCó tính cơ động cao, có thể cài nhiều Win khác nhau trên cùng USB. Ngoài việc cài win, bạn có thể tích hợp công cụ cứu hộ máy tính (cứu dữ liệu, sửa bad sector ổ cứng, xem thông tin phần cứng máy tính…) Tốc độc cài Win nhanh hơn so với cài Win từ đĩa DVD. Nhược điểm\nBạn cần phải sắm cho mình một chiếc USB Cần học cách tạo usb cài win Có 2 cách để tạo usb boot dùng để cài đặt Windows từ USB\nSử dụng phần mềm để tạo usb chuyên dùng để chỉ cài Win: Tạo usb boot cài win với WinToUSB Tạo usb boot đa năng vừa cài win và vừa cứu hộ máy tính bằng 1 click Anhdv Boot Học cài win từ ổ cứng Cài lại Win từ ổ cứng có ưu điểm là không cần DVD hay USB, nhưng máy tính phải vào được Windows. Mình có 2 bài viết hướng dẫn cài đặt Win từ ổ cứng:\nHướng dẫn cài Win từ ổ cứng đơn giản nhất với WinToHDD Hướng dẫn cài Win từ ổ cứng không cần USB, DVD hay phần mềm Cài lại Windows bằng tính năng Reset hoặc Fresh Start Reset hoặc Fresh Start đều là tính năng có sẵn trên Windows 10, 8.1.

    "content": "Hướng Dẫn Cài Đặt Wordpress Trên Localhost Chi Tiết Excerpt Hướng dẫn cài đặt WordPress trên localhost sử dụng Ampps, cách cài WordPress trên localhost hướng dẫn bằng hình ảnh rất chi tiết.\nỞ bài trước mình đã hướng dẫn cách tạo localhost với AMPPS trên máy tính rồi (nếu chưa biết bạn cần phải đọc bài đó trước). Tiếp theo, bài viết này mình sẽ hướng dẫn cách cài đặt WordPress trên localhost để khởi tạo một website WordPress trên máy tính.\nViệc cài đặt WordPress trên localhost cũng khá đơn giản thôi. Chỉ cần làm 1 lần là bạn sẽ nắm vững được cấu trúc thư mục, các thành phần tạo lên web WordPress. Từ đó, khi bạn muốn cài đặt WordPress trên hosting, bạn sẽ làm được một cách đơn giản.\nTrong bài này mình sẽ hướng dẫn cách cài đặt WordPress trên localhost dùng Ampps theo cách cơ bản nhất để người mới tìm hiểu về WordPress cũng có thể hiểu được.\nBước 1: Tải bộ cài đặt mã nguồn WordPress Để cài đặt WordPress trên localhost bạn cần phải có bộ cài WordPress, bạn hãy tải phiên bản mới nhất của WordPress tại địa chỉ https://wordpress.org/latest.zip\nSau khi tải về bạn có được file wordpress-x.zip (x- ở đây là số phiên bản). Ở thời điển mình cập nhật bài này WordPress đang ở phiên bản wordpress-6.0.3.zip.\nGiải nén file này ra sẽ được 1 thư mục có tên là “wordpress” trong thư mục này có chứ các file và thư mục như wp-admin, wp-includes, wp-content và index.php, wp-config-sample.php,…Tất cả file và thư mục trong này là bộ cài đặt của mã nguồn WordPress.\nBước 2. Copy mã nguồn WordPress vào thư mục web trên localhost Bây giờ, hãy copy toàn bộ file và thư mục ở trong thư mục “wordpress” vừa giải nén ra vào thư mục lưu trữ của website trên localhost.\nTrong bài viết trước, mình đã tạo 1 website với domain ảo là blogtietkiem.com có đường dẫn lưu trữ là C:\\Ampps\\www\\blogtietkiem.com\nTương tự như vậy, bạn đã tạo web với đường dẫn như nào thì copy source vào thư mục lưu trữ ở đường dẫn đó nha.\nBước 3. Tạo database cho web Để cài đặt được WordPress yêu cầu bạn phải có 1 database. Bởi WordPress sẽ lưu các dữ liệu động như nội dung bài viết, các thiết lập,… của website vào trong database đó.\nTrong bài hướng dẫn trước mình đã tạo được 1 database với thông tin như sau:\nDatabase name: blogtietkiem Database user: root (tên mặc định của Ampps) Database password: mysql (mật khẩu mặc định của Ampps) Database Host: localhost Nếu bạn đã tạo database theo như bài hướng dẫn đó của mình thì hãy sử dụng thông tin đó để cài đặt WordPress ở bước dưới. Còn bạn chưa biết tạo database thì có thể xem hướng dẫn tạo database ở trong bài viết này.\nBước 4. Tiến hành cài đặt WordPress trên localhost Sau khi chuẩn bị đầy đủ các bước cần thiết ở trên, bạn truy cập vào đường dẫn website. Ở đây mình truy cập vào địa chỉ blogtietkiem.com.\n– Ngay màn hình đầu tiên, nó sẽ hiện ra bảng chọn ngôn ngữ cần cài đặt cho WordPress, mình chọn Tiếng Việt và ấn Tiếp tục.\n– WordPress sẽ nhắc bạn cần chuẩn bị các thông tin kết nối đến database để nó tạo file wp-config.php. Bạn hãy ấn Thực hiện ngay! để tiến hành cài đặt WordPress.\n– Đến đây, bạn nhập thông tin database đã tạo trước đó vào để kết nối tới database như sau.\n– Database Name (Tên cơ sở dữ liệu) là tên database đã tạo ở bước 3 (của mình là blogtietkiem).\n– Đối với localhost tạo bởi AMPPS bạn sẽ có các thông số mặc định như sau:\nUser Name (Tên cơ sở dữ liệu): root Password (Mật khẩu): mysql Database Host (Địa chỉ máy chủ databse): localhost – Table Prefix là tiền tố của database chứa dữ liệu WordPress, mặc định nó sẽ là wp_, chúng ta có thể đổi nó thành bất cứ cái gì nhưng phải bắt buộc có _ đằng sau. (bạn chưa hiểu rõ thì cứ để nguyên như vậy).\n– Khi nhập đầy đủ chính xác thông tin database, hãy ấn nút Gửi để tiến hành kết nối.\n– Nếu nó hiện ra như hình dưới thì nghĩa là bạn đã nhập thông tin database chính xác, hãy ấn nút Bắt đầu cài đặt để tiến hành cài đặt WordPress trên localhost.\n– Ở bước này, bạn cần thiết lập các thông tin cho website như Tên website, tên đăng nhập và mật khẩu, email tài khoản quản trị web.\n– Ở mục Hiển thị với công cụ tìm kiếm bạn không tích vào nếu muốn các công cụ tìm kiếm như Google, Bing, Cốc Cốc,… index trang web của bạn.\n– Nhập xong hãy ấn nút Cài đặt WordPress.\n– Nếu không có lỗi gì xảy ra màn hình thông báo Thành công! hiện lên nghĩa là bạn đã cài đặt WordPress trên localhost xong rồi.\n– Bạn ấn vào Đăng nhập để vào trang quản trị của WordPress và bạn sẽ thấy giao diện trang quản trị WordPress như sau.\nChú ý: Từ nay về sau, để truy cập vào trang quản trị web WordPress bạn cần chỉ cần thêm /wp-admin vào sau tên miền là được. Chẳng hạn: blogtietkiem.com/wp-admin\nLời kết Qua bài này, bạn đã biết cách cài đặt WordPress trên localhost dùng Ampps với các bước cơ bản là như thế nào rồi đó. Nếu muốn thực hành ngay trên hosting thì bạn có thể đọc và làm theo hướng dẫn ở bài viết hướng dẫn tạo website bằng WordPress này.\nTổng kết lại là để cài đặt WordPress bạn sẽ cần có bộ mã nguồn WordPress và 1 database để lưu trữ dữ liệu động của web.\nBạn hãy thực hành cài đặt WordPress trên localhost thật nhiều lần cho quen đi nhé. Nếu có bất kỳ thắc mắc nào hãy cùng thảo luận ở bên dưới nhé.\nKhi đã thành thạo rồi thì chuyển sang bài viết tiếp theo của series học WordPress trên blog Nguyễn Hùng nha!\nBài trước: Hướng dẫn tạo localhost chuyên nghiệp với Ampps\nBài tiếp: Hướng dẫn cách viết bài viết mới trong WordPress\nBạn thích nội dung như này?\nNguyễn Hùng sẽ gửi cho bạn những thông tin bổ ích như này qua email mỗi khi có bài mới. Hơn 2000+ người đang nhận thông tin!\nNói không với spam!\nNguyễn Hùng Internet là nơi mình học được những gì về Wordpress, SEO, SEM, MMO và kiến thức máy tính.

    "content": " Obsidian là một ứng dụng ghi chú và quản lý kiến thức cá nhân mạnh mẽ giúp bạn có thể hệ thống những kiến thức có giá trị mình tiếp nhận được trong đời sống hàng ngày.\nSau bài chia sẻ về các ứng dụng ghi chú cá nhân tốt nhất, tôi tiếp tục loạt bài viết cụ thể hơn về cách sử dụng Obsidian trong ghi chú và hệ thống hoá kiến thức cá nhân để các bạn đọc quan tâm thể bắt đầu làm quen với ứng dụng này dễ dàng hơn. Hành trình sử dụng Obsidian khá thú vị nhưng cũng không ít gian nan để có thể sử dụng thành thạo, trong khuôn khổ cuốn cẩm nang này, tôi sẽ cung cấp cho các bạn một lộ trình hoàn chỉnh để làm chủ Obsidian. Đừng quên bookmark bài viết này vì nội dung của bài viết sẽ liên tục được cập nhật (đây là một bài viết rất chi tiết và chuyên sâu). Bạn có thể tham khảo lộ trình làm chủ obsidian qua video chia sẻ dưới đây, sơ đồ mindmap được chia sẻ trong video tại đây.\nNội dung chính [Ẩn]\nI. Vì sao nên ghi chú với Obsidian? Review ứng dụng ghi chú tốt nhất theo từng phong cách ghi chú II. Cài đặt Obsidian để sử dụng 2.1. Cài đặt 2.2. Thiết lập cơ bản 2.3. Sử dụng Obsidian Plugin 2.3.1. Các Plugin thiết yếu 2.3.2. Các Plugin nâng cao 2.4. Đồng bộ dữ liệu Obsidian giữa các thiết bị 2.4.1. Đồng bộ dữ liệu giữa Desktop và cloud 2.4.2. Đồng bộ dữ liệu giữa Mobile và Cloud III. Ghi chú với markdown trong Obsidian Markdown là gì? Hướng dẫn sử dụng Markdown A-Z IV. Phương pháp ghi chú và tổ chức thông tin 4.1. Phương pháp PARA Phương pháp PARA trong tổ chức thông tin hiệu quả V. Kết luận I. Vì sao nên ghi chú với Obsidian? Trong thời đại kỹ thuật số, chúng ta tiếp xúc với một lượng lớn thông tin hàng ngày về mọi mặt của cuộc sống và tốc độ thay đổi chóng mặt của các kiến thức khiến nhu cầu về một công cụ quản lý kiến thức cá nhân (Personal Knowledge Management, viết tắt là PKM) dần trở nên quan trọng. Một ứng dụng PKM giúp bạn ghi lại và theo dõi các ý tưởng, tổ chức các thông tin thiết yếu và khiến chúng sẵn sàng để truy cập khi cần một cách tiện lợi. Tổ chức tốt một cơ sở dữ liệu cá nhân cũng giúp đầu óc bạn được thư giãn khi không phải ghi nhớ quá nhiều thông tin mà có thể tập trung nhiều hơn vào việc tạo ra các ý tưởng đột phá từ thông tin có được.\nĐây là 5 lý do bạn nên bắt đầu sử dụng Obsidian theo kinh nghiệm 2 năm sử dụng của tôi:\nObsidian là ứng dụng mã nguồn mở miễn phí, đa nền tảng và chạy cục bộ (không cần kết nối internet). Điều này có nghĩa là bạn có thể sử dụng Obsidian trên bất kỳ thiết bị nào từ máy tính đến smartphone dù chúng chạy bất kỳ hệ điều hành nào. Để ủng hộ nhà phát triển, bạn có thể chọn phiên bản trả phí để sử dụng tính năng đồng bộ dữ liệu, xuất bản thông tin lên web dễ dàng. Obsidian sử dụng Markdown để định dạng ghi chú, đây là ngôn ngữ đánh dấu đơn giản và dễ học. Thực chất markdown là một file văn bản thuần túy (plain text) có thể đọc được bằng bất kỳ phần mềm soạn thảo văn bản mặc định nào trên các thiết bị từ máy tính đến smartphone. Điều này có nghĩa là bạn có thể yên tâm các ghi chú của mình sẽ tồn tại theo năm tháng cho đến tận đời con cháu vẫn có thể sủ dụng mà không cần mất thêm một đồng nào cho dịch vụ ghi chú có bản quyền. Với cú pháp markdown, ghi chú của bạn có thể được hiển thị với định dạng như các nội dung trên website khi mở bằng ứng dụng thích hợp. Thực tế nhiều người đang sử dụng các cú pháp markdown trong nhắn tin hoặc soạn thảo văn bản nhưng không hề biết về nó. Nếu bạn đã từng đọc phần giới thiệu của gói phần mềm bất kỳ trên Github có tên README.md, đó chính là nội dung ghi chú sử dụng định dạng markdown (file có phần mở rộng *.md). Cũng bởi Obsidian cung cấp tính năng Backlink cho phép liên kết các ghi chú không giới hạn. Với backlink, bạn có thể tạo liên kết từ một ghi chú đến một ghi chú khác, giúp bạn dễ dàng truy cập và tổ chức các thông tin liên quan với nhau. Với tính năng backlink trong Obsidian, bạn có thể tạo cho riêng mình một kho kiến thức như thể wikipedia được cá nhân hóa vậy. Obsidian cung cấp tính năng Graph view thú vị (biểu đồ thể hiện mạng liên kết giữa các ghi chú với nhau). Chế độ Graph view cho phép bạn dễ dàng hình dung và điều hướng các ghi chú cũng như ý tưởng của mình, giúp bạn dễ dàng hiểu được các kết nối và mối quan hệ các phần thông tin khác nhau. Điều này đặc biệt hữu ích khi bạn tiếp nhận và tổ chức các các kiến thức mới hàng ngày một cách linh hoạt mà không bị bó buộc phải sắp xếp chung thông tin vào một số file hay thư mục cụ thể như các công cụ ghi chú tuyến tính. Obsidian cung cấp nhiều plugin và tích hợp mạnh mẽ và miễn phí từ nhóm phát triển lẫn cộng đồng đóng góp. Điều này giúp bạn dễ dàng tùy biến Obsidian theo cách mình thích và tích hợp không giới hạn với workflow (luồng công việc) của mình. Tất nhiên điều này cũng yêu cầu bạn có chút đam mê mày mò và khám phá như những người dùng có gu một chút. Nếu bạn không có nhiều thời gian nhưng vẫn muốn trải nghiệm đầy đủ các plugin chất lượng thì vẫn có cách tải thư mục cấu hình sẵn về máy để sử dụng ngay. Tóm lại, Obsidian là một ứng dụng quản lý kiến thức và ghi chú mạnh mẽ và linh hoạt có thể giúp bạn tăng năng suất và tối ưu hóa quy trình làm việc của mình. Nó cung cấp một loạt các tính năng và tích hợp để giúp bạn luôn ngăn nắp và hoàn thành công việc của mình một cách đầy hứng thú. Đây là một phần mềm nguồn mở hoàn toàn miễn phí sử dụng và tôi thực sự khuyên dùng phần mềm này cho bất kỳ ai đang tìm kiếm một công cụ quản lý kiến thức và ghi chú mạnh mẽ và hiệu quả.\nReview ứng dụng ghi chú tốt nhất theo từng phong cách ghi chú Khi bàn về việc tìm một ứng dụng ghi chú cá nhân (note-taking app) phù hợp cho nhu cầu soạn…\nII. Cài đặt Obsidian để sử dụng 2.1. Cài đặt **Bản desktop\n**Bạn có thể tải Obsidian tại trang web chính thức: https://obsidian.md/. Obsidian cung cấp ứng dụng desktop dành cho tất cả các hệ điều hành hiện nay gồm macOS, Windows, và Linux.\n**Bản cho thiết bị di động\n**Trên các thiết bị di động, bạn có thể tải Obsidian cho iPhone, iPad từ App Store hoặc tải Obsidian cho Android từ Google Play Store.\n2.2. Thiết lập cơ bản Tôi cung cấp sẵn file zip chứa thư mục thiết lập sẵn để các bạn có thể tải về sử dụng ngay và bỏ qua các bước cài đặt rắc rối. Bạn truy cập vào Github rep tại đây , chọn tải file Source code (zip) về máy. Bạn cũng có thể tìm thấy hướng dẫn và thông tin giới thiệu tại file README.md của repo này.\nĐối với các bạn Newbie, thường sẽ mất khá nhiều thời gian để bắt đầu thiết lập Obsidian trong lần đầu sử dụng. Obsidian cho phép bạn cá nhân hoá phần mềm để sử dụng ở mức độ cao nhưng cũng đồng nghĩa với việc khi tải Obsidian về sử dụng lần đầu tiên, bạn sẽ không có gì ngoài một số tính năng cơ bản như những text editor thông thường (trình soạn thảo văn bản). Đây sẽ là những việc bạn sẽ phải làm nếu không sử dụng thư mục cấu hình sẵn:\nThiết lập giao diện Tạo một cấu trúc các thư mục để tổ chức các ghi chú Tìm tòi các community plugin hay ho để cài đặt bổ sung tính năng cho Obsidian. Obsidian có thư viện plugin do cộng đồng đóng góp rất phong phú. Thiết lập các core plugin (tiện ích có sẵn của Obsidian khi cài đặt) Tạo các template ghi chú Thiết lập định dạng ngày, tháng, thời gian cho ghi chú Thiết lập phím tắt Giao diện của Obsidian khi cài đặt theo Vault mẫu Obsidian Go V3\n2.3. Sử dụng Obsidian Plugin Trong Obsidian, plugin được chia thành 2 nhóm là Core plugins do Obsidian cung cấp và Community plugins do cộng đồng tự phát triển. Core plugins: có sẵn khi các bạn cài đặt Obsidian trên thiết bị, tuy nhiên bạn cần cấu hình các plugin để tiện lợi nhất theo nhu cầu sử dụng của mình.\nCommunity plugins: theo mặc định thì tính năng này bị tắt, để có thể sử dụng community plugins (nếu bạn dùng sẵn file cấu hình tôi cung cấp) hoặc bắt đầu tìm kiếm để cài đặt thêm các plugin thì cần bật tính năng này lên. Hầu hết các plugin được dùng phổ biến trên Obsidian đều miễn phí, bạn có thể donate để ủng hộ tác giả, một số plugin đặc biệt thì cần mua. Hiện tại, tôi không dùng bất kỳ community plugin nào trả phí.\nCho phép sử dụng Community Plugin trên Obsidian\nĐể cài đặt một Community plugin bất kỳ, bạn vào mục cài đặt (phím tắt Cmd + , trên macOS hoặc Ctrl + , trên Windows), tìm đến mục Community plugins \u003e Browse . Trong cửa sổ mở ra tiếp theo, hãy gõ tên plugin bạn cần tìm và cài đặt.\nTìm và cài đặt Community Plugin trên Obsidian\n2.3.1. Các Plugin thiết yếu Tất cả các plugin có sẵn trong danh sách Core plugins đều được xem là nhóm plugin thiết yếu, bạn có thể bật hết các plugin này để sử dụng, ngoại trừ Sync và Publish (nếu bạn không dùng bản trả phí). Ngoài ra, tôi gợi ý thêm 1 số Community plugin quan trọng mà bạn nên cài đặt để bắt đầu:\nObsidian Editing Toolbar\nPlugin này giúp bạn có thể định dạng ghi chú của mình với 1 thanh công cụ tương tự như khi soạn thảo văn bản với bộ công cụ Office (Words, Docs) để những bạn mới có thể thực hiện công việc của mình trơn tru trong khi làm quen với markdown. Mặc định, bạn chỉ gõ văn bản và định dạng kiểu cho ghi chú của mình bằng các ký tự (hoàn toàn dùng bàn phím mà không cần chuột) nên plugin này giúp bạn đỡ bị sốc khi chuyển đổi bộ công cụ của mình. Obsidian Editting Toolbar\n**Advanced Mobile Toolbar\n**Nếu sử dụng Obsidian bản mobile thì đây là công cụ không thể thiếu bởi gõ bằng bàn phím vật lý trên desktop và dùng markdown thì đơn giản nhưng soạn thảo văn bản bằng điện thoại (hoặc tablet) và gõ cú pháp markdown với bàn phím ảo nữa thì không hiệu quả và rất vất vả vì màn hình điện thoại bé thao tác cảm ứng mất thời gian.\nObsidian Advanced Mobile Toolbar | Samsung Galaxy Note\n**Advanced Tables\n**Không sớm thì muộn, bạn cũng sẽ nhận ra việc tạo và quản lý nội dung một bảng với cú pháp markdown không được thuận tiện như khi làm việc với các công cụ soạn thảo văn bản trực quan khác. Đây là plugin bạn nên có để soạn thảo các bảng trong Obsidian tiện lợi và gọn gàng hơn. Nó sẽ giúp bạn canh dòng, quản lý hàng và cột tiện lợi, tự động điều chỉnh layout để trông đoạn text dùng cho việc định dạng bảng ngăn nắp hơn. Ngoài ra trên thanh sidebar cũng sẽ bổ sung công cụ định dạng để bạn chọn nhanh chóng.\n2.3.2. Các Plugin nâng cao Để đọc thêm thông tin chi tiết và cài đặt các plugin dưới đây để sử dụng, bạn có thể Browse để tìm Community Plugin trong phần cài đặt như hướng dẫn bên trên. Các community plugin hầu hết đều công khai mã nguồn (open-source) trên Github, bạn có thể xem source code và cân nhắc trước khi sử dụng nếu có kiến thức về lập trình. Dưới đây là các plugin tôi đã/đang sử dụng và thấy hữu ích, bạn có thể tham khảo để cài đặt nếu thấy phù hợp nhu cầu của mình.\nPhân loại Tên Plugin Mô tả Soạn thảo văn bản Outliner Định dạng và quản lý các ghi chú có chứa các danh sách (list) tiện lợi và trực quan, cho phép thu gọn/mở rộng theo mục. Smart Typography Định dạng ghi chú tự động (linting) theo các “rule” phổ biến. Data Loom Tạo và quản lý bảng tính trong Obsidian trực quan, thao tác kéo thả quen thuộc theo phong cách Notion. Advanced Tables Tạo và chỉnh sửa bảng markdown tiện lợi và nhanh chóng. Mind map Tạo mind map từ văn bản dạng danh sách (bullet points và đánh số thứ tự). Cần mở cửa sổ preview để xem. Mermaid Tool Tạo và hiển thị các lưu đồ (flowchart) trong Obsidian sử dụng cú pháp mermaid. Banners Cho phép chèn hình banner và avatar cho mỗi ghi chú tương tự Notion. Natural Language Dates Chèn ngày tháng, thời gian vào ghi chú bằng ngôn ngữ tự nhiên. Ví dụ @today để chèn ngày hôm nay, @time: now để chèn giờ hiện tại. Bạn có thể tuỳ chình định dạng ngày tháng, thời gian theo sở thích. Emoji shortcodes Chèn emoji bằng shortcode khi soạn văn bản. Ví dụ, để chèn ????, bạn gõ bằng :wink . Khi bắt đầu gõ : thì plugin này sẽ gợi ý cho bạn một danh sách emoji để chọn. Nếu không dùng plugin này, bạn mở hộp thoại chèn emoji trên macOS bằng Ctr + Cmd + Space hoặc Windows + ; rồi chọn emoji. Note Refactor Cho phép tinh chỉnh hành vi tự động của Obsidian khi bạn muốn tách nhỏ 1 ghi chú thành nhiều ghi chú nhỏ hơn. Ghi chú cá nhân (Journal) Calendar Cho phép hiển thị 1 ô chứa lịch (ngày tháng) để click chọn mở hoặc tạo mới ghi chú theo ngày trên lịch. Ghi chú được tạo cũng được tự động định dạng tên theo ngày tháng và một số thiết lập về nơi lưu trữ ghi chú, template được sử dụng, vv. Periodic Notes Cho phép bạn thiết lập và quản lý các ghi chú thường xuyên theo ngày/tuần/tháng/quý/năm. Plugin này rất tiện lợi cho những người có thói quen viết ghi chú dạng “reflection” (suy tưởng). Ghi chú trực quan (Visual Note-taking) Excalidraw Một ứng dung tuyệt vời để vẽ (sketch/doodling), tạo ghi chú trực quan (visual note-taking) trong Obsidian. Plugin này sử dung mượt và nhiều tính năng thú vị, hoạt động tốt trên cả bản Obsidian desktop lẫn mobile. Xuất bản Pandoc Plugin Cho phép xuất ghi chú markdown sang bất cứ định dạng nào bạn muốn với Pandoc. Bạn cần cài đặt kèm pandoc trên máy tính. Pandoc là một công cụ chuyển đổi tài liệu mạnh mẽ và đa năng, bạn có thể tìm hiểu thêm thông tin chi tiết tại pandoc.org. Quản lý thời gian/dự án Obsidian TODO Text-based GTD Reminder Cho phép đặt lời nhắc để bạn thực hiện những việc trong to-do list của mình. Tasks Plugin đi kèm để sử dụng Reminder. Flexible Pomodoro for Obsidian Hiển thị đồng hồ bấm giờ Pomodoro và thực hiện công việc theo phong cach Pomodoro trong Obsidian khá tiện dụng. Cho phép theo dõi lại log các việc thực hiện với Pomodoro. Kanban Cho phép tạo kanban board sử dụng để quản lý dự án rất tiện lợi. Tinh chỉnh giao diện Hider Cho phép ẩn các thành phần bất kỳ của Obsidian trên giao diện Obsidian, kích hoạt và tắt tính năng ẩn với phím tắt. Icon Folder Một plugin đơn giản cho phép bạn tùy biến icon đại diện cho folder và file xuất hiện trong giao diện sử dụng của Obsidian. Bằng cách thêm các biểu tượng trực quan, tôi tìm và chuyển đổi giữa các thư mục, file quan trọng một cách nhanh chóng thay vì đọc tên của chúng. Style Cho phép tùy chỉnh tất cả các mục xuất hiện trong Obsidian. Mình ít tùy biến Obsidian nhưng cài đặt hiển thị các màu sắc nổi bật cho heading để dễ nhìn khi kích thước font các heading không khác biệt nhiều. Truy vấn Dataview Cho phép sử dụng query để truy xuất các ghi chú và nội dung của nó trong Obsidian tương tự như bạn query với một database. Tôi sử dụng plugin này để chèn vào ghi chú mới khi viết Journal cho mục On this day. 2.4. Đồng bộ dữ liệu Obsidian giữa các thiết bị 2.4.1. Đồng bộ dữ liệu giữa Desktop và cloud Hướng dẫn chính thức từ Obsidian bằng tiếng Anh tại đây\na. macOS\nNếu bạn sử dụng Obsidian trên hệ sinh thái thiết bị của Apple thì iCloud là dịch vụ duy nhất bạn có thể sử dụng để đồng bộ dữ liệu/ghi chú của mình giữa thiết bị desktop với cloud và mobile. Cách thiết lập khá đơn giản:\nTạo thư mục chứa các ghi chú Obsidian trong iCloud folder (mở bằng Finder) Từ Obsidian, chọn Open folder as Vault và tìm đến thư mục bạn chọn (như trên) và bắt đầu sử dụng. Nếu bạn bắt đầu sử dụng Obsidian với thư mục cấu hình sẵn (tôi chia sẻ trên Github ở mục Cài đặt của bài viết) thì chỉ cần copy thư mục sau khi giải nén vào iCloud và Open folder as vault để sử dụng.\nChọn thư mục lưu trữ ghi chú trong Obsidian. Open as Vault\nb. Windows/Linux:\nĐối với máy tính Windows thì Onedrive đã được tích hợp sẵn vào hệ điều hành, bạn chỉ cần đăng nhập tài khoản Microsoft vào ứng dụng Onedrive trên máy tính để bắt đầu sử dụng. Các bước thực hiện đồng bộ tương tự như tôi hướng dẫn với macOS, trong trường hợp này bạn chọn nơi lưu trữ thư mục Obsidian là OneDrive thay vì iCloud. Trong trường hợp máy tính của bạn chưa được cài sẵn Onedrive, thì bạn có thể tải về tại đây.\nNếu bạn sử dụng Google Drive làm dịch vụ đồng bộ thì chắc chắn cũng cần cài ứng dụng Google Drive trên máy tính của mình, các bước thực hiện tương tự như Onedrive và iCloud. Tương tự với các dịch vụ cloud khác như Dropbox, vv hoặc kể cả bạn sử dụng Ubuntu hoặc các phiên bản hệ điều hành Linux.\n2.4.2. Đồng bộ dữ liệu giữa Mobile và Cloud iPhone/iPad\nChỉ cần cài đặt Obsidian trên thiết bị và mở thư mục Obsidian từ iCloud trên bộ nhớ máy của bạn.\nAndroid\nBạn có thể chọn một trong 2 ứng dụng từ bên thứ 3 là Folder Sync hoặc Drop Sync. Tôi sử dụng Folder Sync bản trả phí (có thể dùng miễn phí kèm quảng cáo cũng không phiền lắm). Lý do phải dùng dịch vụ của bên thứ 3 mà không phải app chính thức OneDrive, Google Drive, vv là bởi các app này không cho phép đồng bộ dữ liệu và lưu trữ chúng vào một thư mục cụ thể trên bộ nhớ máy để bạn có thể mở và sửa đổi ghi chú với Obsidian.\nDưới đây là video tôi hướng dẫn cụ thể cách thiết lập đồng bộ với Folder Sync và Onedrive.\nIII. Ghi chú với markdown trong Obsidian Ghi chú trong Obsidian sử dụng cú pháp markdown khá đơn giản, tuy nhiên quá trình làm quen với cách thức soạn thảo văn bản này xa lạ với phần lớn người dùng phổ thông. Một điểm thú vị khi ghi chú với markdown là bạn hoàn toàn chỉ cần gõ bằng bàn phím mà không bị mất tập trung vào các biểu tượng để định dạng văn bản như khi hầu hết chúng ta quen sử dụng Microsoft Word. Để trở thành một người dùng thành thạo loại ngôn ngữ đánh dấu này trong Obsidian, bạn cần ghi nhớ cú pháp định dạng và các nhóm phím tắt để thao tác nhanh. Hãy đọc thêm bài hướng dẫn chi tiết dưới đây về cách sử dụng markdown từ A-Z.\nMarkdown là gì? Hướng dẫn sử dụng Markdown A-Z Trong bài viết Hướng dẫn sử dụng Obsidian toàn tập, tôi đã đề cập đến Markdown như là phương thức soạn thảo ghi chú với ứng dụng này, trong bài viết này chúng ta cùng tìm hiểu cách sử dụng Markdown một cách trọn vẹn nhất nhé. I. Markdown là gì? Markdown là một dạng […]\nIV. Phương pháp ghi chú và tổ chức thông tin Cùng theo dõi video tôi chia sẻ về tư duy tổ chức thông tin trong Obsidian để bạn có thể hình dung được thực tế sử dụng Obsidian và tự xây dựng cho mình phương pháp phù hợp nhất.\n4.1. Phương pháp PARA PARA là phương pháp tổ chức thông tin do Tiago Forte khởi xướng, được viết trong cuốn sách Building a Second Brain của tác giả. Bạn có thể đọc bài viết chi tiết về phương pháp này tại đây.\nPhương pháp PARA trong tổ chức thông tin hiệu quả Bạn có bao giờ cảm thấy mất kiểm soát trước lượng thông tin khổng lồ mà bạn tiếp nhận hàng ngày và băn khoăn về cách tổ chức chúng một cách hiệu quả chưa? Có lúc bạn đã dành nhiều thời gian để tạo ra hàng tá file và ghi chú, nhưng cuối cùng lại […]\nV. Kết luận Trong phần tiếp theo, tôi sẽ hướng dẫn cho bạn cách bắt đầu với Obsidian và tận dụng các tính năng mạnh mẽ của nó. Tôi sẽ đề cập đến cách thiết lập, tạo và sắp xếp các ghi chú phù hợp với nhu cầu của bạn.\n",

Those releases don’t result in announcements on the What’s new page.\nEntries on the What’s new page are checked and enforced during the version-release GitHub Action.\nManaging Issues Issues are categorized and managed by assigning labels to it.\nOnce working on an issue, assign it to a fitting maintainer.\nWhen done, close the ticket. Once an issue is closed, it needs to be assigned to next release milestone.\nA once released ticket is not allowed to be reopened and rereleased in a different milestone. This would cause the changelog to be changed even for the milestone the issue was previously released in. Instead write a new ticket.\nManaging Pull Requests If a PR is merged and closed it needs an accompanied issue assigned to. If there is no issue for a PR, the maintainer needs to create one.\nYou can assign multiple PRs to one issue as long as they belong together.\nUsually set the same labels and milestone for the PR as for the accompanied issue.\nLabels Kind An issue that results in changesets must have exactly one of the following labels. This needs to be assigned latest before release.\nLabel Description Changelog section documentation Improvements or additions to documentation - discussion This issue was converted to a discussion - task Maintenance work Maintenance feature New feature or request Features bug Something isn’t working Fixes Impact If the issue would cause a new main release due to semver semantics it needs one of the according labels and the matching badge on the What’s new page.\nLabel Description change Introduces changes with existing installations breaking Introduces breaking changes with existing installations Declination If an issue does not result in changesets but is closed anyways, it must have exactly one of the following labels.\nLabel Description duplicate This issue or pull request already exists invalid This doesn’t seem right support Solved by reconfiguring the authors site unresolved No progress on this issue update A documented change in behaviour wontfix This will not be worked on Halt You can assign one further label out of the following list to signal readers that development on an open issue is currently halted for different reasons.\nLabel Description blocked Depends on other issue to be fixed first idea A valuable idea that’s currently not worked on undecided No decision was made yet helpwanted Great idea, send in a PR needsfeedback Further information is needed 3rd-Party If the issue is not caused by a programming error in the themes own code, you can label the causing program or library.\nLabel Description browser This is a topic related to the browser but not the theme device This is a topic related to a certain device hugo This is a topic related to Hugo itself but not the theme mermaid This is a topic related to Mermaid itself but not the theme Making Releases A release is based on a milestone named like the release itself - just the version number, eg: 1.2.3. It’s in the maintainers responsibility to check semver semantics of the milestone’s name prior to release and change it if necessary.\nMaking releases is automated by the version-release GitHub Action. It requires the version number of the milestone that should be released. The release will be created from the main branch of the repository.\nTreat released milestones as immutable. Don’t rerelease an already released milestone. An already released milestone may already been consumed by your users.\nDuring execution of the action a few things are checked. If a check fails the action fails, resulting in no new release. You can correct the errors afterwards and rerun the action.\nThe following checks will be enforced\nthe milestone exists there is at least one closed issue assigned to the milestone all assigned issues for this milestone are closed if it’s a main release, there must be a new \u003cmajor\u003e.\u003cminor\u003e at the beginning of the What’s new page if it’s a patch release, there must be the \u003cmajor\u003e.\u003cminor\u003e from the previous release at the beginning of the What’s new page After a successful run of the action\nthe History page is updated, including release version, release date and text the What’s new page is updated, including release version, release date and text the version number for the \u003cmeta generator\u003e is updated the updated files are committed the milestone is closed the repository is tagged with the version number (eg. 1.2.3), the main version number (eg. 1.2.x) and the major version number (eg. 1.x) a new entry in the GitHub release list with the according changelog will be created the official documentation is built and deployed the version number for the \u003cmeta generator\u003e is updated to a temporary and committed (this helps to determine if users are running directly on the main branch or are using releases) a new milestone for the next patch release is created (this can later be renamed to a main release if necessary) ",

Cú pháp này quá quen thuộc nhưng có thể bạn không biết nó là markdown.\n\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003cspan id=\"__span-2-1\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003eMục 1 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan id=\"__span-2-2\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003eMục 2 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan id=\"__span-2-3\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003eMục 2a \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan id=\"__span-2-4\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003eMục 2b \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan id=\"__span-2-5\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan id=\"__span-2-6\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e1.\u003c/span\u003e Mục 1 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan id=\"__span-2-7\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e2.\u003c/span\u003e Mục 2 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan id=\"__span-2-8\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e3.\u003c/span\u003e Mục 3 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan id=\"__span-2-9\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003eMục 3a \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan id=\"__span-2-10\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003eMục 3b \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003eKết quả thu được như sau:\nQuotes - Câu trích dẫn¶ Để tạo ra đoạn văn trích dẫn bắt mắt, bạn sử dụng dấu mũi tên \u003e trước văn bản mình muốn định dạng.\n\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ccode tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"__span-3-1\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026gt; \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHướng dẫn sử dụng Obsidian markdown bằng tiếng Việt này được tạo ra giúp bạn làm quen với cú pháp Markdown một cách dễ hiểu, nhanh chóng và đầy đủ nhất.\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003eĐây là kết quả:\nHướng dẫn sử dụng Obsidian markdown bằng tiếng Việt này được tạo ra giúp bạn làm quen với cú pháp Markdown một cách dễ hiểu, nhanh chóng và đầy đủ nhất.\nĐể tạo ra nhiều kiểu định dạng ấn tượng cho các đoạn chú thích khác như minh họa dưới đây, bạn tham khảo phần định dạng Callout.\nCode - đoạn mã lập trình¶ Để chèn một đoạn mã lập trình với cú pháp markdown, bạn sử dụng cặp dấu backtick (ngay phía dưới phím Esc trên bàn phím) để bao quanh đoạn mã. Nếu chèn khối mã bao gồm nhiều dòng thì dùng cặp 3 dấu backtick để biểu thị.

Để tạo ra phần bình luận cho văn bản (chỉ hiển thị khi soạn thảo mà không xuất ra màn hình khi xem), bạn sử dụng cặp dấu %% bao quanh đoạn văn bản mục tiêu.

Trong các trình soạn thảo văn bản hỗ trợ Markdown như Obsidian, Visual Studio Code bạn chỉ cần copy và paste ảnh vào nội dung văn bản đang soạn thảo sẽ được tự động định dạng để hiển thị hoàn hảo. Nếu sử dụng link ảnh trên web thì cần chèn link vào phần url ảnh như trên.\n\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ccode tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"__span-9-1\"\u003e![\u003cspan\u003eKhóa học Web scraping với Python\u003c/span\u003e](\u003cspan\u003ehttps://learn-anything.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/khoa-hoc-python-web-scraping.png\u003c/span\u003e) \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003eKết quả hiển thị như sau:\nKhi sử dụng ảnh trong thư mục của máy tính, bạn có thể sử dụng địa chỉ chính xác hoặc địa chỉ tương đối đến file ảnh:\nĐịa chỉ chính xác (absolute path): D:\\Github\\learn-anything-knowledge\\docs\\assets\\images\\python_course_4_thinhvu_square.png Địa chỉ tương đối (relative path): /assets/images/python_course_4_thinhvu_square.png Bạn cũng có thể không cần đặt tên cho ảnh trong cặp ngoặc [], như vậy cú pháp rút gọn sẽ là [](url ảnh hoặc đường dẫn file ảnh trên máy tính).\nĐể thay đổi kích thước ảnh, bạn chèn thông tin khổ ảnh vào trong cặp dấu [] như sau:\n![Khóa học Web scraping với Python | 400](https://learn-anything.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/khoa-hoc-python-web-scraping.png)\nKết quả thu được như sau, trong đó 400 thể hiện cho chiều rộng hiển thị là 400px của ảnh.\nLink - Chèn Liên kết từ web¶ Bạn có thể sử dụng markdown để chèn liên kết bất kỳ đến bài viết, hình ảnh hoặc tài nguyên trên web. Cú pháp để thực hiện việc này chỉ khác so với khi chèn ảnh là không có dấu ! ở đầu.\n[Truy cập khóa học](https://learn-anything.vn/course/phan-tich-du-lieu-voi-python-khoa-4/)\nTrả về kết quả là: Truy cập khóa học\nMarkdown Obsidian¶ Lưu ý\nCác cú pháp markdown trình bày trong mục này hầu hết chỉ hoạt động và hiển thị đúng trong Obsidian mà không tương thích với các kiểu markdown khác.\nBacklink - Liên kết nội bộ¶ Để liên kết một ghi chú khác có trong vault Obsidian, bạn sử dụng cặp dấu ngoặc nhọn [[]] bao quanh tên ghi chú của bạn. Ví dụ ghi chú được liên kết dưới đây có tên là Internal link.\n\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003cspan id=\"__span-10-1\"\u003eLiên kết đến một trang: [[Internal link]]. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003eLiên kết Obsidian¶ Obsidian URI cho phép bạn mở các ghi chú từ một vault Obsidian bất kỳ hoặc từ một chương trình khác. Liên kết được chèn phải thuộc Vault bất kỳ bạn đã thiết lập với Obsidian.\nNếu trong liên kết có chứa khoảng trắng thì cách dễ nhất để thoát các khoảng trắng này (escape - giúp chương trình hiểu thành phần của liên kết vẫn tiếp tục) là sử dụng cặp dấu \u003c\u003e bao quanh liên kết.\nCách khác, bạn phải mã hóa liên kết (ví dụ dấu cách trong tên file phải được thay thế bằng %2F) theo kiểu mã hóa URI (encoding).\n\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ccode tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"__span-11-1\"\u003e[\u003cspan\u003eLiên kết đến ghi chú\u003c/span\u003e](\u003cspan\u003e\u0026lt;obsidian://open?path=D:\\OneDrive\\Github\\gardening\\_notes\\Cộng đồng vnstock python.md\u0026gt;\u003c/span\u003e) \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003eLiên kết đến ghi chú\nEmbed - Nhúng¶ Nhúng cho phép bạn hiển thị nội dung của một ghi chú khác vào trong ghi chú bạn đang soạn thảo. Việc này tương tự bạn chèn một cửa sổ iframe vào trang web để hiển thị, ví dụ như chèn 1 video Youtube.\nTrong ví dụ này, chúng ta chèn và hiển thị nội dung có trong ghi chú có tên Obsidian là gì vào ghi chú hiện tại. Việc này giúp bạn tận dụng các đoạn nội dung đã viết khi cần lặp lại trong nhiều ngữ cảnh khác nhau.\n",

Chỉ cần sử dụng đường link sau và thay thế “word” bằng bất kỳ từ nào trong tiếng Anh mà bạn cần học cách phát âm.\nVi dụ, dưới đây là một số file mẫu mà bạn có thể click chuột phải và tải trực tiếp về máy tính của mình:\nVà mẹo này thậm chí có thể dùng được với những từ khó như :\nNếu các bạn dùng add-on Instant Multi Search trên Google Chrome (hoặc Cốc Cốc) như mình đã chỉ trong các video trước, thì khi lắp dòng link trên kia vào phần tìm kiếm của add-on này, các bạn hãy thay từ “WORD” bằng biểu tượng “%s” nhé, như thế này:\n(chữ “WORD” được thay bằng chữ “%s”)\nNhân tiện thì đây là toàn bộ các link đã được code sẵn mà mình dùng trong add-on Instant Multi Search của mình, bạn nào cần thì copy lại mà xài nhé.\nCác link trên tự động tìm một lúc trên 5 nơi: Nguồn phát âm của Google, nguồn phát âm của Forvo (một kho phát âm lớn, có điều cần tạo tài khoản free rồi đăng nhập xong mới down được), từ điển Oxford, từ điển Cambridgre, từ điển Wikitionary (bản tiếng Việt), và tìm kiếm trên Google (để lấy hình ảnh).\nTừ giờ mình sẽ dùng tag để các bạn dễ tìm nhé. Click vào tag là sẽ ra tất cả các bài viết có cùng tag đó. Mình cũng sẽ dần dần bổ sung tag vào các bài viết khác của mình cho các bạn dễ tìm nhé !\n",

    "content": " Excerpt Tận dụng sức mạnh của kho plugin đồ sộ trong Obsidian để nâng cao hiệu quả công việc.\nSoạn thảo văn bản Outliner Định dạng và quản lý các ghi chú có chứa các danh sách (list) tiện lợi và trực quan, cho phép thu gọn/mở rộng theo mục. Smart Typography Định dạng ghi chú tự động (linting) theo các “rule” phổ biến. Data Loom Tạo và quản lý bảng tính trong Obsidian trực quan, thao tác kéo thả quen thuộc theo phong cách Notion. Advanced Tables Tạo và chỉnh sửa bảng markdown tiện lợi và nhanh chóng. Mind map Tạo mind map từ văn bản dạng danh sách (bullet points và đánh số thứ tự). Cần mở cửa sổ preview để xem. Mermaid Tool Tạo và hiển thị các lưu đồ (flowchart) trong Obsidian sử dụng cú pháp mermaid. Banners Cho phép chèn hình banner và avatar cho mỗi ghi chú tương tự Notion. Natural Language Dates Chèn ngày tháng, thời gian vào ghi chú bằng ngôn ngữ tự nhiên. Ví dụ @today để chèn ngày hôm nay, @time: now để chèn giờ hiện tại. Bạn có thể tuỳ chình định dạng ngày tháng, thời gian theo sở thích. Emoji shortcodes Chèn emoji bằng shortcode khi soạn văn bản. Ví dụ, để chèn ????, bạn gõ bằng :wink . Khi bắt đầu gõ : thì plugin này sẽ gợi ý cho bạn một danh sách emoji để chọn. Nếu không dùng plugin này, bạn mở hộp thoại chèn emoji trên macOS bằng Ctr + Cmd + Space hoặc Windows + ; rồi chọn emoji. Note Refactor Cho phép tinh chỉnh hành vi tự động của Obsidian khi bạn muốn tách nhỏ 1 ghi chú thành nhiều ghi chú nhỏ hơn. Ghi chú cá nhân (Journal) Calendar Cho phép hiển thị 1 ô chứa lịch (ngày tháng) để click chọn mở hoặc tạo mới ghi chú theo ngày trên lịch. Ghi chú được tạo cũng được tự động định dạng tên theo ngày tháng và một số thiết lập về nơi lưu trữ ghi chú, template được sử dụng, vv. Periodic Notes Cho phép bạn thiết lập và quản lý các ghi chú thường xuyên theo ngày/tuần/tháng/quý/năm. Plugin này rất tiện lợi cho những người có thói quen viết ghi chú dạng “reflection” (suy tưởng). Ghi chú trực quan (Visual Note-taking) Excalidraw Một ứng dung tuyệt vời để vẽ (sketch/doodling), tạo ghi chú trực quan (visual note-taking) trong Obsidian. Plugin này sử dung mượt và nhiều tính năng thú vị, hoạt động tốt trên cả bản Obsidian desktop lẫn mobile. Xuất bản Pandoc Plugin Cho phép xuất ghi chú markdown sang bất cứ định dạng nào bạn muốn với Pandoc. Bạn cần cài đặt kèm pandoc trên máy tính. Pandoc là một công cụ chuyển đổi tài liệu mạnh mẽ và đa năng, bạn có thể tìm hiểu thêm thông tin chi tiết tại pandoc.org. Quản lý thời gian/dự án Obsidian TODO | Text-based GTD Cho phép uản lý danh sách các việc cần làm từ tất cả các ghi chú hoặc công việc xuất hiện trong Obsidian (hộp check box chưa được đánh dấu hoàn thành). Reminder Cho phép đặt lời nhắc để bạn thực hiện những việc trong to-do list của mình. Tasks Plugin đi kèm để sử dụng Reminder. Flexible Pomodoro for Obsidian Hiển thị đồng hồ bấm giờ Pomodoro và thực hiện công việc theo phong cach Pomodoro trong Obsidian khá tiện dụng. Cho phép theo dõi lại log các việc thực hiện với Pomodoro. Kanban Cho phép tạo kanban board sử dụng để quản lý dự án rất tiện lợi. Tinh chỉnh giao diện Hider Cho phép ẩn các thành phần bất kỳ của Obsidian trên giao diện Obsidian, kích hoạt và tắt tính năng ẩn với phím tắt. Icon Folder Một plugin đơn giản cho phép bạn tùy biến icon đại diện cho folder và file xuất hiện trong giao diện sử dụng của Obsidian. Bằng cách thêm các biểu tượng trực quan, tôi tìm và chuyển đổi giữa các thư mục, file quan trọng một cách nhanh chóng thay vì đọc tên của chúng. Style Cho phép tùy chỉnh tất cả các mục xuất hiện trong Obsidian. Mình ít tùy biến Obsidian nhưng cài đặt hiển thị các màu sắc nổi bật cho heading để dễ nhìn khi kích thước font các heading không khác biệt nhiều. Truy vấn Dataview Cho phép sử dụng query để truy xuất các ghi chú và nội dung của nó trong Obsidian tương tự như bạn query với một database. Tôi sử dụng plugin này để chèn vào ghi chú mới khi viết Journal cho mục On this day.\n",

To save time and avoid manual effort, we can automate the entire software development lifecycl…\nVòng đời phát triển phần mềm như viết, kiểm tra và đẩy mã lên kho GitHub tốn rất nhiều công sức và khá thời gian.\nĐể tiết kiệm thời gian và tránh nỗ lực thủ công, chúng tôi có thể tự động hóa toàn bộ vòng đời phát triển phần mềm với sự trợ giúp của nền tảng GitHub Actions rất mạnh mẽ .\nTrong bài viết này, chúng tôi sẽ đề cập đến GitHub Actions là gì, nó giải quyết vấn đề gì, cách bạn xây dựng hành động và một ví dụ thực tế.\nHành động GitHub là gì? GitHub Actions là một nền tảng mạnh mẽ để tự động hóa quy trình làm việc của bạn, bao gồm xây dựng, thử nghiệm và triển khai mã.\nNó cho phép bạn xác định quy trình công việc tùy chỉnh được kích hoạt bởi các sự kiện khác nhau, chẳng hạn như khi bạn đẩy mã vào kho lưu trữ hoặc khi ai đó mở yêu cầu kéo.\nBạn có thể tự động hóa toàn bộ vòng đời phát triển phần mềm của mình bằng GitHub Actions, từ viết và kiểm tra mã đến triển khai vào sản xuất.\nBạn cũng có thể sử dụng các hành động được xác định trước do cộng đồng GitHub cung cấp hoặc tạo các hành động để sử dụng trong quy trình làm việc của mình.\nvấn đề gì nó giải quyết? GitHub Actions giải quyết vấn đề về các tác vụ thủ công, tốn thời gian trong quá trình phát triển phần mềm bằng cách cung cấp cách tự động hóa các tác vụ này.\nBằng cách sử dụng Hành động, bạn có thể tạo quy trình công việc tùy chỉnh được kích hoạt bởi các sự kiện cụ thể, chẳng hạn như khi mã được đẩy đến kho lưu trữ hoặc ai đó mở yêu cầu kéo.\nĐiều này cho phép bạn tự động hóa toàn bộ vòng đời phát triển phần mềm của mình, từ viết và kiểm tra mã đến triển khai vào sản xuất.\nĐiều này có thể tiết kiệm thời gian và giảm khả năng xảy ra lỗi, cho phép bạn tập trung vào các nhiệm vụ quan trọng hơn.\nCác thành phần của hành động GitHub GitHub Actions có một số thành phần quan trọng phối hợp với nhau để cho phép tự động hóa quy trình làm việc của bạn.\nSự kiện : Các sự kiện xảy ra trong kho lưu trữ của bạn, chẳng hạn như khi bạn đẩy mã đến một nhánh hoặc khi ai đó mở yêu cầu kéo. Khi một sự kiện xảy ra, nó có thể kích hoạt một quy trình công việc để chạy.\nQuy trình công việc : Quy trình công việc là các quy trình tự động tùy chỉnh mà bạn xác định trong kho lưu trữ của mình. Một quy trình công việc bao gồm một hoặc nhiều công việc và có thể được kích hoạt bởi một số sự kiện nhất định.\nCông việc : Công việc là những nhiệm vụ tạo nên một quy trình công việc. Một công việc có thể thực hiện một loạt các bước, chẳng hạn như xây dựng và thử nghiệm mã hoặc triển khai nó vào sản xuất.\nNgười chạy : Người chạy là các máy hoặc môi trường ảo chạy các công việc trong quy trình làm việc. Bạn có thể sử dụng trình chạy do GitHub cung cấp hoặc bạn có thể sử dụng trình chạy tự lưu trữ của mình.\nHành động : Hành động là những đoạn mã được xác định trước mà bạn có thể sử dụng trong quy trình làm việc của mình. Bạn có thể sử dụng các hành động do cộng đồng GitHub cung cấp hoặc tạo các hành động để sử dụng trong quy trình làm việc của mình.\nPhát lại phiên mã nguồn mở OpenReplay là bộ phát lại phiên, mã nguồn mở cho phép bạn xem người dùng làm gì trên ứng dụng web của mình, giúp bạn khắc phục sự cố nhanh hơn. OpenReplay tự lưu trữ để kiểm soát hoàn toàn dữ liệu của bạn.\nBắt đầu tận hưởng trải nghiệm sửa lỗi của bạn - bắt đầu sử dụng OpenReplay miễn phí .\nVí dụ thực tế về Hành động GitHub Một ví dụ thực tế về việc sử dụng GitHub Actions là tự động hóa việc xây dựng, thử nghiệm và triển khai mã của bạn.\nVí dụ: bạn có thể tạo quy trình làm việc được kích hoạt khi mã được đẩy tới nhánh của kho lưu trữ main.\nQuy trình làm việc có thể thực hiện một loạt công việc, chẳng hạn như xây dựng mã, chạy thử nghiệm và triển khai mã vào sản xuất.\nDưới đây là ví dụ về tệp quy trình làm việc cho kịch bản này có thể trông như thế nào:\n\u003cspan\u003ename:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eBuild,\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eTest,\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eand\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eDeploy\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eon:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003epush:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003ebranches:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003emain\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003ejobs:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003ebuild:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eruns-on:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eubuntu-latest\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003esteps:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003euses:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eactions/checkout@v2\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003euses:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eactions/setup-node@v1\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003ewith:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003enode-version:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e16\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003erun:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003enpm\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003einstall\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003erun:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003enpm\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003erun\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003ebuild\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003etest:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eruns-on:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eubuntu-latest\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003esteps:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003euses:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eactions/checkout@v2\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003euses:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eactions/setup-node@v1\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003ewith:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003enode-version:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e16\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003erun:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003enpm\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003einstall\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003erun:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003enpm\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003etest\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003edeploy:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eruns-on:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eubuntu-latest\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003esteps:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003euses:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eactions/checkout@v2\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003euses:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eactions/setup-node@v1\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003ewith:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003enode-version:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e16\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003erun:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003enpm\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003einstall\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e-\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003erun:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003enpm\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003erun\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003edeploy\u003c/span\u003eMã này xác định quy trình công việc được GitHub Actions tự động chạy trên một số sự kiện nhất định. Quy trình làm việc có ba công việc: build, test, và deploy. Những công việc này được thực hiện theo thứ tự chúng xuất hiện trong mã.\nKhối onchỉ định thời điểm quy trình làm việc sẽ được kích hoạt. Trong trường hợp này, nó được kích hoạt khi mã được đẩy tới nhánh main.\nactions/checkout@v2là một Hành động GitHub cho phép bạn kiểm tra kho lưu trữ hoặc một nhánh, cam kết hoặc gắn thẻ cụ thể trong kho lưu trữ. Nó thường được sử dụng trong quy trình làm việc để sao chép kho lưu trữ và kiểm tra mã ở một bản sửa đổi cụ thể.\nactions/setup-node@v1là một Hành động GitHub thiết lập môi trường Node.js trên trình chạy. Nó thường được sử dụng trong quy trình làm việc để cài đặt và định cấu hình một phiên bản cụ thể của Node.js cũng như mọi gói hoặc phụ thuộc bắt buộc.\nThe v2và v1in actions/checkout@v2và actions/setup-node@v1, tương ứng, đề cập đến phiên bản của hành động. Hành động có thể có nhiều phiên bản và mỗi phiên bản có thể có chức năng hoặc hành vi khác nhau.\nMỗi công việc bao gồm các bước được thực hiện theo thứ tự chúng xuất hiện trong mã. Công buildviệc đầu tiên sử dụng hành động actions/checkout@v2 để kiểm tra mã từ kho lưu trữ. Sau đó, nó sử dụng hành động actions/setup-node@v1 để thiết lập môi trường Node.js đã cài đặt phiên bản 16.\nCuối cùng, nó chạy lệnh npm installvà npm run buildđể cài đặt các phần phụ thuộc cần thiết và xây dựng mã.\nCông testviệc tương tự như buildcông việc, nhưng thay vì chạy npm run buildlệnh, nó chạy npm testlệnh để thực hiện kiểm tra mã.\nCông deployviệc cũng tương tự như buildcông việc nhưng thay vì chạy lệnh npm run buildthì nó chạy npm run deploylệnh triển khai mã.\nTóm lại, mã này xác định quy trình làm việc được kích hoạt khi mã được đẩy đến nhánh main. Quy trình làm việc chạy các buildcông testviệc deploytheo thứ tự đó, mỗi công việc bao gồm một loạt các bước để kiểm tra mã, thiết lập môi trường Node.js và chạy các lệnh cụ thể để xây dựng, kiểm tra và triển khai mã.\nPhần kết luận Tóm lại, GitHub Actions là một nền tảng mạnh mẽ để tự động hóa quy trình phát triển phần mềm của bạn.\nNó cho phép bạn xác định quy trình công việc tùy chỉnh được kích hoạt bởi các sự kiện khác nhau, chẳng hạn như khi bạn đẩy mã vào kho lưu trữ hoặc khi ai đó mở yêu cầu kéo.\nBạn có thể tự động hóa toàn bộ vòng đời phát triển phần mềm của mình bằng GitHub Actions, từ viết và kiểm tra mã đến triển khai vào sản xuất.\nBạn cũng có thể sử dụng các hành động được xác định trước từ cộng đồng GitHub hoặc tạo các hành động trong quy trình làm việc của mình.\nBằng cách sử dụng Hành động, bạn có thể tiết kiệm thời gian, công sức và tập trung vào các nhiệm vụ quan trọng hơn.\nVà đó là tất cả cho chủ đề này. Cảm ơn bạn đã đọc.\nĐọc thêm Dưới đây là một số tài nguyên có thể giúp bạn tìm hiểu về GitHub Actions:\nTài liệu hành động GitHub chính thức\nDiễn đàn cộng đồng GitHub Actions\nKênh YouTube GitHub có một số video về GitHub Actions.\nGitHub Actions Marketplace có một tập hợp các hành động được tạo sẵn mà bạn có thể sử dụng trong quy trình làm việc của mình.\n",

    "content": "Excerpt Sử dụng properties (metadata) và các trường thông tin mô tả một ghi chú bất kỳ giúp bạn phân loại và tổ chức thông tin trong Obsidian khoa học, thuận tiện.\nobsidian sử dụng hàng ngày properties metadata\nGiới thiệu\nMetadata hay properties trong Obsidian (hay YAML frontmatter trong markdown) là những thông tin bạn miêu tả các thuộc tính, đặc điểm nhận dạng một ghi chú bất kỳ của bạn. Việc này giúp bạn phân loại, lưu trữ, tra cứu và sử dụng được dễ dàng, thuận tiện nhất. Ngoài ra trong Obsidian, bạn có thể sử dụng plugin Dataview để thống kê, biểu diễn thông tin có trong hệ cơ sở dữ liệu ghi chú của mình một cách linh hoạt và thú vị.\nQuá trình quản lý, ghi chú và sử dụng¶ Quá trình quản lý ghi chú với thuộc tính metadata\nToàn bộ quá trình quản lý ghi chú bằng thông tin mô tả thuộc tính/metadata được tóm tắt như dưới đây. Trong đó bạn sẽ có thêm ý tưởng rõ ràng để hình dung về các loại mẫu ghi chú mình thường xuyên sử dụng cũng như các thuộc tính quan trọng nhất mình sử dụng cho từng loại ghi chú.\nQuá trình quản lý, ghi chú và sử dụng gồm 3 bước chính như sau:\nTạo mẫu ghi chú (template) Phân loại thông tin mô tả khi ghi chú Tra cứu (sử dụng thông tin đã mô tả) Tạo mẫu ghi chú¶ Giới thiệu templates\nMẫu ghi chú hay templates được cài đặt trong Obsidian tại mục Templates (một core plugin có sẵn) cho phép bạn sử dụng một mẫu ghi chú đã có cấu trúc sẵn để chèn vào một ghi chú khi bạn làm việc. Tính năng này thích hợp cho lối tư duy mạch lạc, có cấu trúc và hỗ trợ bạn việc phân loại ghi chú của mình tốt hơn thông qua các trường thông tin đã cấu trúc sẵn.\nHệ thống hóa tất cả ghi chú của bạn với mẫu tương ứng¶ Có một sự thật là bạn có thể tạo ra các mẫu ghi chú bao quát toàn bộ hoạt động trong cuộc sống thường ngày của bạn từ công việc đến mục đích cá nhân, từ sáng tạo nội dung cho đến học tập hay viết luận. Hãy thử áp dụng Nguyên tắc MECE và Nguyên lý kim tự tháp Minto mà mình giới thiệu qua blog này để giúp bạn tư duy mạch lạc và tổ chức các chi chú của mình chặt chẽ nhất.\nMình chia hệ thống mẫu ghi chú cho cá nhân thành 2 nhóm chính như dưới đây. bạn có thể tìm thấy một số mẫu trong hệ thống Obsidian Go mình chia sẻ.\nCÔNG VIỆC (Professional): Các ghi chú công việc thể hiện đặc trưng cho hoạt động tại công ty, dự án yêu cầu tính chuyên nghiệp. Một vài ví dụ giúp bạn dễ hình dung hơn.\nNew Notes: Các ghi chú chung chưa phân loại hoặc có mẫu cụ thể. Meeting Notes: ghi chú cuộc họp Documentation: các ghi chú công việc chung hoặc thuật lại các phương pháp, cách thức thực hiện một số công việc phức tạp cần lưu lại. Decision Log: Ghi chú lại bối cảnh và cách tiếp cận khi ra các quyết định quan trọng. Retrospective: Đánh giá lại hoạt động, dự án hoặc kết quả của bộ phận theo tháng/quý. Brainstorming: Mẫu tư duy và tìm kiếm ý tưởng. To-do: Công việc thường ngày, hoặc theo kế hoạch cần làm. Sử dụng kèm các plugin như Project, Kanban, Obsidian GTD Research: Các ghi chú mang tính chất nghiên cứu, tìm kiếm và tổng hợp thông tin cho chủ đề hoặc một lĩnh vực công việc. Presentation: Tổng hợp nội dung cho bài trình bày, câu chuyện cụ thể. CÁ NHÂN (Personal): Tất cả các ghi chú còn lại không thuộc lĩnh vực công việc.\nDaily Notes: nhật ký nhìn nhận lại một số sự kiện quan trọng diễn ra trong ngày. Book Highlights: Các đoạn trích dẫn từ việc đọc sách (chủ yếu xuất ra từ Kindle). Life Reflection: Mẫu ghi chú này giúp mình nhìn nhận lại hành trình, kết quả thực hiện các mục tiêu trong khung thời gian dài hoặc những bài học sau những sự kiện đáng nhớ trong cuộc sống. People profile: Ghi chú lại những thông tin quan trọng về một người cụ thể xuất hiện trong cuộc sống của mình, có thể là bạn bè, đối tác hoặc những cá nhân mình cảm thấy có một sự hiểu biết, ghi nhớ cá nhân về họ để phát triển mối quan hệ. Blog / Script: là nội dung các bài viết hoặc bản thảo cho nội dung video dự định xuất bản. Thành phần \u0026 nội dung của mẫu ghi chú¶ Một mẫu ghi chú có thể chia thành 2 phần chính:\nMetadata (hay phần thông tin mô tả, trong Obsidian được gọi là Properties). Phần thông tin mô tả này khi xem trong chế độ Source mode được bao quanh bởi cặp dấu ---. Khi soạn thảo với Obsidian chế độ Live Preview sẽ được trình bày như dưới đây. Nội dung ghi chú mẫu là cấu trúc các thành phần, hướng dẫn hoặc điều bạn muốn nhắc nhở bản thân mình làm theo trình tự, khung nội dung thống nhất với bất kỳ ghi chú nào trong cùng một loại bạn đã định hình. Ví dụ dưới đây là mẫu ghi chú hàng ngày của mình với 4 nhóm thông tin chính gồm:\nWin the day: Việc mình muốn hoàn thành trong ngày\" được nêu ra khi bắt đầu một ngày Reflection: Ghi lại một vài sự kiện chính và hồi tưởng lại một ngày đã qua, đánh giá lại mục tiêu có hoàn thành hay chưa.

Bạn cũng có thể hỏi ChatGPT để tạo ra các mẫu ghi chú markdown theo kiểu/chủ đề nhất định sau khi đã nghĩ ra các loại thông tin mình cần ghi chú.\nCuối cùng, bạn tạo các file ghi chú, đặt chung trong một thư mục tại Vault của mình. Ví dụ, trong Vault của mình có thư mục template là thư mục con trong 3. RESOURCE/src/template. Sau đó, bạn vào phần cài đặt Settings \u003e Templates thuộc core plugins để chọn địa chỉ thư mục mẫu nói trên tại mục Template folder location.\nPhân loại thông tin mô tả¶ Giới thiệu\nKhi bắt đầu bất kỳ một ghi chú mới, việc bạn cần làm là chèn mẫu ghi chú đã thiết lập theo đúng nội dung mình đang cần tạo ra. Việc này ví như bạn điền “giấy khai sinh” cho ghi chú của mình.\nMình thường bắt đầu ghi chú mới bằng cách nhấn tổ hợp phím Ctrl + Shift + Alt + T đã gán từ trước cho tính năng Templates để chọn mẫu ghi chú cần sử dụng. Bạn cũng có thể chèn mẫu qua 2 cách khác phổ biến bao gồm:\nCommand palette: Sử dụng tổ hợp phím tắt Ctrl + P và tìm kiếm với từ khóa template để tìm hành động là Templates: Insert template. Tính năng tìm lệnh này được bật mặc định khi cài Obsidian, nếu bạn sử dụng tổ hợp phím tắt mà không kích hoạt được tính năng thì vào phần Settings \u003e Core plugins tìm và kích hoạt tính năng. Slash command: Sử dụng dấu / và nhập từ khóa tìm kiếm lệnh trong giao diện ghi chú tại vị trí bất kỳ, Enter hoặc click chuột vào lệnh để chọn kích hoạt lệnh tương tự như với Command Palette. Với các mẫu ghi chú được chèn, bạn lần lượt điền các thông tin mô tả ở phần thuộc tính ghi chú (properties) để tiến hành phân loại/tổ chức thông tin của mình. Tips quan trọng\nBạn nên chèn sẵn các thông tin mô tả cơ bản cho từng loại ghi chú ngay trong mẫu. Ví dụ với status mặc định sẽ có giá trị là raw, tags với bài viết blog của mình sẽ có giá trị #obsidian, #metadata, phần category sẽ là Blog, Youtube chẳng hạn. Việc này giúp cho nhiệm vụ phân loại của bạn chỉ đơn giản là chèn mẫu ghi chú và chỉnh sửa, thêm 1 vài thông tin cụ thể cho ghi chú của mình thay vì làm “nô lệ” cho việc mô tả lặp đi lặp lại tốn thời gian.\nTra cứu và sử dụng thuộc tính¶ Tìm kiếm trong Obsidian¶ Với tính năng tìm kiếm trong Obsidian thì cú pháp ở đây khá đơn giản thôi, bạn sử dụng tên file hoặc một thuộc tính bất kỳ của loại ghi chú mục tiêu và thực hiện tìm kiếm.\nTrong ví dụ minh họa, mình lọc tất cả ghi chú có trạng thái là raw tức mới chỉ ở giai đoạn ý tưởng và có chứa từ CCCD thì nhận được 13 kết quả bao gồm 2 kết quả dưới đây.\nDataView¶ Đoạn mã Dataview dưới đây có thể được chèn vào một ghi chú bất kỳ trong Obsidian để hiển thị dữ liệu/ghi chú/kết quả lọc được trả về từ câu truy vấn. Bạn cũng có thể sử Dataview kết hợp một thẻ/ghi chú bất kỳ trong chế độ Obsidian Canvas để tạo ra trang tổng quan như ý muốn.\n\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003cspan id=\"__span-1-1\"\u003e TABLE status, file.ext AS type WHERE contains(lower(file.name), \"obsidian\") \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan id=\"__span-1-2\"\u003e SORT status ASC \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003eTrong đó, thành phần của câu truy vấn gồm:\nTABLE: hiển thị dữ liệu trả về dưới dạng bảng, dạng khác có thể là LIST, TASK, CALENDAR status, file.ext là tên các cột hiển thị bổ sung cho cột File mặc định. status là thuộc tính được tạo tự do, trong khi file.ext là thuộc tính tên định dạng file (mặc định của file ghi chú khi được tạo ra). AS cho phép đổi tên file.ext thành type cho thuận tiện mục đích sử dụng WHERE là thao tác lọc các kết quả theo điều kiện đặt ra, ví dụ tên file tức thuộc tính file.name phải chứa chữ obsidian dù viết hoa hay thường (sử dụng hàm lower() để định dạng tên file về kiểu chữ thường để so sánh). SORT cho phép sắp xếp cột status theo chiều thuận ASC tức ascending. Chi tiết về cách sử dụng Dataview, bạn có thể tham khảo tại trang web chính thức tại đây\nTada, dưới đây là kết quả trả về từ câu truy vấn trên, được hiển thị trong một thẻ (card) của Obsidian Canvas. Thuộc tính ghi chú vs lý lịch công dân qua CCCD¶ Hình dung dễ hiểu\nNhà nước quản lý công dân bằng cơ sở dữ liệu dân cư, bạn quản lý ghi chú trong kho tàng của mình thông qua cấu trúc thư mục, tên và các thuộc tính lưu trữ bên trong file hay cụ thể ở đây là ghi chú trên hệ thống máy tính, bộ nhớ cloud của bạn. Dưới đây là một sự so sánh giúp bạn dễ hình dung và hình thành cho mình cách quản lý thông tin hiệu quả.\nCác thông tin trong CCCD¶ Từ bảng so sánh dưới đây, mình tin bạn đã có một sự hình dung rõ ràng về cách tạo và quản lý các ghi chú trong Obsidian của mình một cách có tổ chức.\nCác thông tin sơ yếu lý lịch thường gặp¶ Dưới đây là một số thông tin các bạn thường gặp trong mẫu lý lịch công việc, và tương tự bạn cũng có thể mô phỏng thuộc tính ghi chú của mình kiểu vậy để tiện sử dụng.\n",

    "content": "Trong bài viết trước blogchiasekienthuc [.] com đã từng giới thiệu với các bạn cách để tải bộ cài đặt Windows nguyên gốc từ trang chủ Microsoft rồi.\nĐó là cách dùng script để dò tìm link tải trên Server lưu trữ của MS, nhưng rất tiếc là 2 trong 3 cách mà admin đã giới thiệu cho các bạn trước đó đã bị Microsoft fix nên bây giờ không còn hoạt động được nữa.\nChính vì thế anh Kiên đã up link ISO thay thế do anh tự tải về và upload lên cho các bạn tải, đó cũng là một cách hay và không lo bị MS xóa link.\nTuy nhiên, nếu như bạn vẫn muốn tải các bộ cài Windows hoặc Office nguyên gốc (link gốc từ Microsft) thì đây chính là bài viết dành cho bạn.\nHôm nay mình sẽ giới thiệu cho các bạn một công cụ cho phép tải file ISO nguyên gốc từ Server của Microsoft được phát triển bởi blogger công nghệ Wzor.\nAnh cam kết tất cả file ISO anh cung cấp đều leech trực tiếp từ server của Microsoft chứ không hề thông qua bất kỳ bên thứ ba nào, kể cả anh.\n#1. Tải về bộ cài Windows hoặc Office nguyên gốc + Bước 1 : Đầu tiên các bạn truy cập vào địa chỉ trang web này: https://tb.rg-adguard.net\nĐây là giao diện chính của trang web. Như các bạn có thể thấy là giao diện website rất trực quan và đơn giản.\nViệc của bạn chỉ là chọn sản phẩm, phiên bản và tải về. Trong bài hướng dẫn này mình sẽ lấy ví dụ tải phiên bản Windows 7 – 32bit nhé.\n+ Bước 2 : Select Type\nChọn loại file, bộ cài mà bạn muốn tải về (bạn có thể chọn Office hoặc Windows, có cả bản Insider cho các bạn luôn).\nDo mình đang muốn tải bộ cài Windows 7, nên mình sẽ chọn là Windows (Final)\n+ Bước 3 : Select Version\nTại đây các bạn hãy chọn phiên bản Windows mà bạn muốn tải. Có rất nhiều và đầy đủ cho các bạn lựa chọn.\nNote:\nĐây là bản cập nhật tháng 3/2017 dành cho Windows 7 đã bao gồm bản vá chống Ramsomware Wannycry đã làm mưa gió một thời.\n+ Bước 4 : Select Edittion\nChọn bản phát hành, tại đây thì bạn có thể chọn phiên bản Windows Home, Pro hoặc là Ultimate…\nĐọc thêm bài viết:\nSự khác nhau giữa các bản Windows (Pro, Home, Ultimate..) Nên sử dụng bản Windows 10 nào? Home/Pro/Enter hay Edu + Bước 5 : Select language\nChọn ngôn ngữ, bạn có thể chọn là English.\n+ Bước 6 : Select file\nỞ phần này bạn hãy chọn nền tảng (32bit hoặc 64bit) mà bạn muốn sử dụng.\nĐọc thêm: Cách chọn bản Windows phù hợp với cấu hình máy tính + Bước 7 : Okey, sau khi đã lựa chọn hết các thông tin cần thiết thì trang web sẽ đưa ra link tải cho bạn, đồng thời cung cấp các thông tin chi tiết về bản ISO mà bạn sắp tải về (ví dụ như ngày phát hành, dung lượng, …)\nDo file được leech trực tiếp từ server của Microsoft nên rất ổn định và luôn Max Speed khi tải xuống.\nNếu như bạn sử dụng phần mềm tăng tốc download idm thì tốc độ sẽ khá nhanh (~4,5Mb/s).\nTips:\nCác bạn có thể thấy như hình bên dưới, link được leech trực tiếp từ Server của MS nhé.\n#2. Update thêm một cách tải bộ cài Windows từ trang chủ của Microsoft **Note:\n**Với cách này bạn chỉ có thể tải được phiên bản Windows mới nhất từ Microsft thôi nhé, bạn sẽ không thể chọn được các phiên bản cũ hơn hoặc là Windows 7, 8 hay 8.1.\n+ Bước 1: Trước tiên, bạn hãy truy cập vào địa chỉ sau để tải: [Windows 10 / Windows 11]\n1/ Sử dụng MediaCreationTool + Bước 2: Tại giao diện chính, bạn hãy bấm vào nút Download tool now để tải về công cụ Media Creation Tool do Microsoft cung cấp.\nĐây là cách duy nhất mà MS cung cấp cho người dùng tải về. Lát nữa mình sẽ hướng dẫn thủ thuật tải không cần phải sử dụng công cụ Media Creation Tool này.\n+ Bước 3: Sau khi tải công cụ MediaCreationTool.exe về thì bạn hãy chạy file đó. Một cửa sổ hiện ra như hình bên dưới, bạn nhấn vào Accept để đồng ý.\n+ Bước 4: Nhấn vào dòng Create installation media...... như hình bên dưới.\n+ Bước 5: Ở cửa sổ tiếp theo bạn hãy lựa chọn thông tin phù hợp, ví dụ như:\nLanguage: Chọn ngôn ngữ. Edittion: Chọn phiên bản, thực ra là chỉ có 1 bản Windows Edition, chứa nhiều phiên bản trong đó rồi. Architecture: Chọn nền tảng Windows 32bit hoặc là 64bit. Sau khi chọn xong bạn nhấn Next để đi tiếp.\n+ Bước 6: Chọn kiểu file mà bạn muốn tải về. Bạn hãy tích vào dòng ISO file để chúng ta sẽ tải bộ cài với định dạng *.iso.\nNote:\nKhi sử dụng công cụ MediaCreationTool thì trong bộ cài sẽ là file install.esd chứ không phải file install.wim như các cách tải thông thường.\nLý do là vì file có định dạng *.esd sẽ được nén tốt hơn so với định dạng *.wim .\nBạn có thể đọc bài này để hiểu thêm nhé: Tại sao bộ cài Win 10 không có file install.wim, mà là file install.esd\nCuối cùng nhấn Next là bạn đã có thể tải về được rồi.\n2/ Thủ thuật tải bộ cài Windows mới nhất không cần MediaCreationTool Sau khi vào đường link ở Bước 1 thì bạn hãy nhấn tổ hợp phím Ctrl + Shift + I hoặc nhấn chuột phải vào trang web (sử dụng trình duyệt web Google Chrome) =\u003e chọn Kiểm tra để vào chế độ dành cho nhà phát triển.\nSau đó bạn hãy chọn cách xem trang web với một thiết bị di động bất kỳ. Ví dụ mình chọn Galaxy S5 chẳng hạn, sau đó bạn hãy nhấn F5 để tải lại trang web.\nTiếp theo bạn hãy nhấn vào tính năng Toogle device toolbar hoặc là sử dụng tổ hợp phím Ctrl + Shif + M.\nOK rồi, bây giờ sẽ có phần Select editon hiện ra cho các bạn chọn link download =\u003e chọn Windows 10 =\u003e nhấn Confirm\nỞ bước tiếp theo, bạn hãy chọn ngôn ngữ rồi tiếp tục nhấn vào Confirm.\nCuối cùng là chọn nền tảng Windows mà bạn muốn tải về là xong.\nHiện tại mình đã mở cửa Blog Chia Sẻ Kiến Thức Store ! – bán phần mềm trả phí với mức giá siêu rẻ – chỉ từ 180.000đ (bản quyền vĩnh viễn Windows 10/11, Office 365, 2021, 2016… và nhiều phần mềm bản quyền khác). Bảo hành full thời gian sử dụng nhé !\n#3. Lời kết Vâng, như vậy là mình đã hướng dẫn rất chi tiết cách tải bộ cài Windows nguyên gốc từ server của Microsoft rồi nhé. Cảm ơn Wzor đã chia sẻ trang web rất hữu ích này.\nHi vọng bài viết sẽ hữu ích với bạn, chúc các bạn thành công !\nCTV: Nguyễn Minh Tiến – Blogchiasekienthuc.com**\nEdit** By Kiên Nguyễn\n",

Click để xem hình lớn hơn.\nCông cụ cần thiết¶ Đây là những công cụ bạn cần có để có thể làm theo hướng dẫn.\nTài khoản Github: Truy cập vào link để tạo tài khoản nếu chưa có. Đồng bộ \u0026 quản lý phiên bản: Tải và cài đặtGithub Desktop. Bạn có thể sử dụng Git và giao diện dòng lệnh nếu đã quen. Soạn thảo Code: Visual Studio Code Soạn thảo Markdown: Obsidian Công cụ bổ sung¶ Những công cụ này nếu bạn cài đặt thêm hoặc sử dụng thì tốt để xem trước trang blog ở môi trường cục bộ (local) trước khi đưa lên web.\nNgôn ngữ lập trình: Ruby cung cấp môi trường để chạy được công cụ Jekyll. Tưởng tượng như nó là hệ điều hành Windows còn Jekyll là một ứng dụng trong Windows vậy. Trình tạo trang tĩnh: Jekyll là công cụ tạo trang web tĩnh kiểu JAMstack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) cho phép tạo ra các trang web nhanh chóng với các thiết lập theo cú pháp. Trình duyệt web: Chrome Trang quản lý tên miền riêng (nếu có) để trỏ tên miền về địa chỉ IP của Github. Hướng dẫn của Github tại đây YAT theme¶ Để sao chép giao diện blog của tôi giới thiệu, bạn có thể clone mã nguồn trên github tại đây\nBạn cũng có thể truy cập trang dự án của giao diện nguyên bản trên Github: yekyll theme yat\nSao chép mã nguồn với Github¶ Đây là bước đầu tiên bạn cần thực hiện, sao chép toàn bộ Github repo về máy để có thể chỉnh sửa cấu hình và viết bài.\nTrong hướng dẫn này bạn sử dụng Github Desktop để sao chép mã nguồn và sau khi hoàn thành chỉnh sửa thì đồng bộ mã nguồn (commit và push) lên trang Github. Bạn có thể xem chi tiết trong video. Cấu hình theme Jekyll YAT¶ Xem chi tiết tại Cài đặt công cụ tạo trang tĩnh Jekyll\nChức năng của các file thiết lập¶ File Gemfile chứa thông tin thiết lập về theme được sử dụng, các gói phụ thuộc cần được chỉ rõ. Trong hướng dẫn ban đầu tác giả nêu không đầy đủ do đó khi sử dụng sẽ gặp lỗi khi thiết lập và người dùng không có kinh nghiệm sẽ loay hoay. File _config.yml chứa tất cả các cài đặt cho site. Bỏ comment cho các dòng lệnh bằng cách xóa dấu # phía trước hoặc bôi đen và chọn phím tắt Ctrl + /. Thay đổi các giá trị mặc định để cập nhật. Thư mục _saas: chứa các file cấu hình định dạng cho website (css) Thư mục _posts chứa các file markdown bài viết cho trang blog. Thư mục _includes có thể chỉnh sửa phần mã tùy chỉnh để theo dõi lượt truy cập website với công cụ Google Tag Manager thông qua file custom_head.html. Ngoài ra các bạn không cần tùy chỉnh thêm trong thư mục này. Thư mục assets chứa các hình ảnh và file sẽ được đính kèm trong bài viết hoặc blog. Tùy biến các file home.html, about.html, archives.html, categories.html, tags.html theo cách đặt tên bạn muốn. Giao diện¶ Đặt properties sidebar: [] để ẩn TOC bên phải Cấu hình sidebar tại file article_menu tại đường dẫn jekyll-theme-yat\\_includes\\sidebar Thay đổi tên Dark/Light thành Tối/Sáng tại file jekyll-theme-yat/_includes/extensions/theme-toggle.html Thay đổi màu sắc chủ đạo cho theme trong _config.yml Theo dõi \u0026 phân tích website¶ Tạo tài khoản Google Analytics (nếu chưa có) tại đây Sửa đổi đoạn mã theo dõi GA thành GTM (nếu cần) tại file jekyll-theme-yat/_includes/extensions/google-analytics.html Soạn thảo bài viết bằng Markdown¶ Tính năng chính¶ YAT theme hỗ trợ nhiều tính năng markdown thú vị, bạn có thể tham khảo thêm chi tiết tại mục Features ở đây.\nDiagram: Có thể sử dụng PlantUML hoặc Mermaid Table: Hỗ trợ nhiều cài đặt như gộp ô, headless Hỗ trợ đa dạng các cú pháp markdown cơ bản lẫn nâng cao. Thiết lập Obsidian để soạn thảo bài viết¶ Có hai thiết lập chính cần lưu ý với Obsidian là Files \u0026 Links và Templates\nLive Preview và tạo trang web¶ Cập nhật cài đặt và xem trước¶ Chỉ áp dụng khi bạn cài Ruby \u0026 Jekyll trên máy tính.\nChạy lệnh bundle install để cài đặt các gói phụ thuộc. Cuối cùng, chạy lệnh bundle exec jekyll serve để chạy local server và xem trước nội dung để có thể tùy biến trang web. Để build (generate site) tại môi trường local, chạy lệnh bundle exec jekyll build từ thư mục dự án. Khi chạy lệnh build, các thay đổi tự động được gán cho nhánh gh-pages. Build local hay github action và github page?¶ Nên sử dụng local mặc dù mất công thiết lập môi trường (1 lần), về sau chạy lệnh build nhanh chóng và cho phép preview trang để dễ dàng debug. Sau khi live preview thành công thì tạo trang web với câu lệnh build và lưu vào 1 nhánh riêng để đẩy lên github thông qua một nhánh riêng, ví dụ gh_pages. Github page chạy mất thời gian, không thể live preview, lỗi thì khó debug hơn hoặc khôi phục lại phiên bản cũ. Thiết lập tên miền riêng¶ Để thiết lập tên miền riêng, bạn thêm tên miền riêng vào mục cài đặt Gihub Pages tại đây Sau đó thêm một bản ghi CNAME cho trang cấu hình DNS của tên miền. Ở đây tôi sử dụng dịch vụ của PA Việt Nam. ",

Đôi khi bạn cần một sự hỗ trợ cho cấu trúc menu lồng nhau mà không có sẵn với Hugo.\nBạn có thể làm theo các bước sau để hỗ trợ cấu trúc menu lồng nhau: -\nCập nhật tệp config.toml để cung cấp cấu hình menu và menu con. Tạo layouts/partials/menu.html để tạo HTML từ cấu hình menu và menu con. Sử dụng menu một phần trong layouts/partials/header.html hoặc layouts/_defaults/baseof.html tùy thuộc vào chủ đề bạn đang sử dụng. Cuối cùng, bạn cần cập nhật tệp style.css của mình bằng CSS liên quan đến menu Làm theo các bước: - Cập nhật config.toml Hãy cập nhật cấu hình menu và menu con để tạo cấu trúc menu lồng nhau như thế này:config.toml\ncấu hình.toml ... [menu] [[menu.main]] identifier = \"home\" name = \"Home\" url = \"/\" weight = 1 [[menu.main]] identifier = \"category\" name = \"Category\" url = \"/category\" weight = 2 [[menu.main]] identifier = \"category1\" name = \"Category1\" url = \"/tags/category1\" parent = \"category\" weight = 1 [[menu.main]] identifier = \"category2\" name = \"Category2\" url = \"/tags/category2\" parent = \"category\" weight = 2 [[menu.main]] identifier = \"category3\" name = \"Category3\" url = \"/tags/category3\" parent = \"category\" weight = 3 [[menu.main]] identifier = \"another-category\" name = \"Another Category\" url = \"/another-category\" weight = 3 [[menu.main]] identifier = \"another-category1\" name = \"Another Category1\" url = \"/tags/another-category1\" parent = \"another-category\" weight = 1 [[menu.main]] identifier = \"another-category2\" name = \"Another Category2\" url = \"/tags/another-category2\" parent = \"another-category\" weight = 2 [[menu.main]] identifier = \"about\" name = \"About Us\" url = \"/about/\" weight = 4Bạn nên hiểu từng trường theo:[[menu.main]]\nMã định danh phải là tên duy nhất của menu trong cấu trúc menu. Nó được sử dụng để xác định menu, menu con và mối quan hệ của chúng bằng cách hugo nội bộ. Tên phải là tên mà bạn muốn hiển thị trên mục menu. url là một URL tương đối sẽ được mở khi bạn nhấp vào mục menu. Trọng lượng là để sắp xếp trình tự các mục menu. Các mục menu có trọng lượng ít hơn sẽ xuất hiện đầu tiên trong menu. Tương tự cũng được áp dụng cho menu con, các mục menu con có trọng lượng nhỏ hơn xuất hiện đầu tiên trong menu thả xuống. Cha mẹ chỉ được sử dụng trong mục menu con để cho biết ai là cha mẹ của menu con. Bạn sử dụng mã định danh của menu cha mẹ trong trường này. Bây giờ chúng ta sẽ sử dụng cấu hình menu và menu con từ tệp để tạo một phần của chúng ta như bên dưới:config.toml``menu.html\nĐây là điều cơ bản nếu bạn muốn tạo menu của riêng mình từ đầu.menu.html\n\u0026lt;nav class=\"nav\"\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul class=\"menu\"\u0026gt; {{ range .Site.Menus.main }} \u0026lt;li class=\"{{ if $currentPage.HasMenuCurrent \"main\" . }}active{{ end }}\"\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span\u0026gt;{{ .Name }}\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {{ if .HasChildren }} \u0026lt;span class=\"drop-icon\" for=\"{{ .Name }}\"\u0026gt;▾\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul class=\"sub-menu\"\u0026gt; {{ range .Children }} \u0026lt;li class=\"{{ if $currentPage.HasMenuCurrent \"main\" . }}active{{ end }}\"\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span\u0026gt;{{ .Name }}\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt;Đây là trang web blog của tôi được tạo bằng Chủ đề Hugo Mainroad.menu.html\n{{- if .Site.Menus.main }} \u0026lt;nav class=\"menu\"\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button class=\"menu__btn\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\" tabindex=\"0\"\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\"menu__btn-title\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u0026gt;{{ T \"menu_label\" }}\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul class=\"menu__list\"\u0026gt; {{- $currentNode := . }} {{- range .Site.Menus.main }} {{- if .Name }} {{- if .HasChildren }} \u0026lt;li class=\"menu__item menu__dropdown{{ if or ($currentNode.IsMenuCurrent \"main\" .)

Trong trường hợp đó, chỉ cần cập nhật một phần menu.html hiện có. Những điều cần lưu ý trong phần trên là sử dụng điều kiện để kiểm tra xem menu con có trẻ em hay không. Nếu nó có con trong menu con, thì chúng tôi lặp lại chúng thông qua việc sử dụng .{{- if .HasChildren }}``{{ range .Children }}\nNgoài ra, lưu ý rằng bạn có thể cần thêm các lớp vào các phần tử HTML theo chủ đề bạn đang sử dụng.\nKhi bạn tạo hoặc cập nhật , hãy nhập phần này vào một trong hai hoặc tùy thuộc vào chủ đề bạn đang sử dụng, nếu không được nhập.layouts/partials/menu.html``layouts/partials/header.html``layouts/defaults/baseof.html\nTạo/Cập nhật static/css/style.css Đây là phần quan trọng nhất của cấu trúc menu lồng nhau. Tôi đã đấu tranh rất nhiều để tạo ra CSS phù hợp cho một phần trên. Đây là phần có liên quan của CSS mà bạn cần thêm vào CSS hiện tại của mình để cấu trúc menu lồng nhau hoạt động.menu.html\ntĩnh/css/style.css /* Main menu */ .no-js .menu__btn { display: none; } .menu__btn { display: block; width: 100%; padding: 0; font: inherit; color: #fff; background: #2a2a2a; border: 0; outline: 0; } .menu__btn-title { position: relative; display: block; padding: 10px 15px; padding: 0.625rem 0.9375rem; font-weight: 700; text-align: right; text-transform: uppercase; cursor: pointer; -webkit-user-select: none; -moz-user-select: none; -ms-user-select: none; -o-user-select: none; user-select: none; } :focus \u003e .menu__btn-title { box-shadow: inset 0 0 1px 3px #e22d30; } button:not(:-moz-focusring):focus \u003e .menu__btn-title { box-shadow: none; } .menu__btn:focus, .menu__btn-title:focus { outline: 0; } .js .menu__btn--active { color: #e22d30; } .menu__list, .submenu__list { list-style: none; background: #2a2a2a; } .menu__item { transition: background-color .25s ease-out; } .menu__item:hover \u003e a { color: #ffa500; } .menu__item:first-child { border: 0; } .menu__item--active { background: #e22d30; } .menu__link { display: block; padding: 10px 15px; padding: 0.625rem 0.9375rem; font-weight: 700; color: #fff; text-transform: uppercase; } .menu__list .menu__item .submenu__list { background: #2a2a2a; visibility: hidden; opacity: 0; position: absolute; max-width: 15rem; transition: all 0.5s ease; border-top: 5px solid #e22d30; display: none; } .menu__item.menu__dropdown input[type=\"checkbox\"] { display: none; } .menu__list .menu__item:hover \u003e .submenu__list, .menu__list .menu__item:focus-within \u003e .submenu__list, .menu__list .menu__item .submenu__list:hover, .menu__list .menu__item .submenu__list:focus { visibility: visible; opacity: 1; display: block; } .menu__link:hover { color: #fff; } .js .menu__list { position: absolute; z-index: 1; width: 100%; visibility: hidden; -webkit-transform: scaleY(0); transform: scaleY(0); -webkit-transform-origin: top left; transform-origin: top left; } .js .menu__list--active { visibility: visible; border-top: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1); border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1); -webkit-transform: scaleY(1); transform: scaleY(1); } .menu__list--transition { transition: visibility 0.15s ease, transform 0.15s ease, -webkit-transform 0.15s ease; } @media screen and (min-width: 767px) { .menu { border-bottom: 5px solid #e22d30; } .menu__btn { display: none; } .menu__list, .js .menu__list { position: relative; display: -webkit-flex; display: flex; -webkit-flex-wrap: wrap; flex-wrap: wrap; visibility: visible; border: 0; -webkit-transform: none; transform: none; } .menu__item { border-left: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1); } } @media screen and (max-width: 767px) { .menu__item.menu__dropdown .drop-icon { position: absolute; right: 1rem; top: auto; width: 50%; text-align: right; } .menu__item.menu__dropdown input[type=\"checkbox\"] + .submenu__list { display: none; } .menu__item.menu__dropdown input[type=\"checkbox\"]:checked + .submenu__list { border: none; padding-left: 20px; visibility: visible; opacity: 1; display: block; position: relative; max-width: 100%; } } @media screen and (max-width: 620px) { .menu__item.menu__dropdown .drop-icon { position: absolute; right: 1rem; top: auto; } .menu__item.menu__dropdown input[type=\"checkbox\"] + .submenu__list { display: none; } .menu__item.menu__dropdown input[type=\"checkbox\"]:checked + .submenu__list { border: none; padding-left: 20px; visibility: visible; opacity: 1; display: block; position: relative; max-width: 100%; } }Nhập CSS này vào một trong hai hoặc tùy thuộc vào chủ đề bạn đang sử dụng, nếu không được nhập.layouts/partials/header.html``layouts/defaults/baseof.html\n{{ $style := resources.Get \"css/style.css\" | resources.ExecuteAsTemplate \"css/style.css\" . -}}Nếu bạn không có javascript trong chủ đề hiện tại của mình, thì hãy sử dụng javascript này thay thế: -menu.js\n'use strict'; (function iifeMenu(document, window, undefined) { var menuBtn = document.querySelector('.menu__btn'); var menu = document.querySelector('.menu__list'); function toggleMenu() { menu.classList.toggle('menu__list--active'); menu.classList.toggle('menu__list--transition'); this.classList.toggle('menu__btn--active'); this.setAttribute( 'aria-expanded', this.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true' ? 'false' : 'true' ); } function removeMenuTransition() { this.classList.remove('menu__list--transition'); } if (menuBtn \u0026\u0026 menu) { menuBtn.addEventListener('click', toggleMenu, false); menu.addEventListener('transitionend', removeMenuTransition, false); } }(document, window));Nhập JS này vào một trong hai hoặc tùy thuộc vào chủ đề bạn đang sử dụng, nếu không được nhập.layouts/partials/header.html``layouts/defaults/baseof.html\n\u0026lt;script async defer src=\"{{ \"js/menu.js\" | relURL }}\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;Xin lưu ý rằng tôi đã giữ các tệp CSS và JS trong thư mục tĩnh. Đây là cách chúng tôi chỉ định điều đó trong cấu hình: -config.toml\ncấu hình.toml assetDir = \"static\"Bây giờ giả sử bạn đã tạo cấu trúc menu và menu con và bây giờ muốn ánh xạ các bài đăng của bạn trong mỗi menu và menu con. Tôi thường làm điều đó bằng cách sử dụng các thẻ.\nGiả sử, tôi muốn ánh xạ các bài đăng của mình trong Danh mục ➞ Thể loại1, tôi làm điều đó bằng cách thêm thẻ ở phía trước như thế này:\nmyblogpost.md --- tags: - \"category1\" ---Bây giờ Hugo sẽ ánh xạ bạn đăng lên URL. Bạn có thể sử dụng URL này để ánh xạ menu con trong /tags/category1``config.toml\ncấu hình.toml [[menu.main]] identifier = \"category1\" name = \"Category1\" url = \"/tags/category1\" parent = \"category\" weight = 1Kết thúc Xin lưu ý rằng tôi hiện đang sử dụng Hugo Mainroad Theme vì vậy ví dụ này sẽ chỉ hoạt động tốt cho chủ đề Mainroad. Đối với các chủ đề khác, bạn cần nỗ lực thêm về mặt tạo menu.html CSS một phần và phù hợp cho cấu trúc menu lồng nhau. Tôi hy vọng hướng dẫn này sẽ cung cấp cho bạn ý tưởng cơ bản về hướng bạn cần đi.\nVui lòng bình luận trong trường hợp bạn tìm thấy bất kỳ vấn đề nào để làm theo hướng dẫn. Cảm ơn bạn đã đọc.\n",

Obsidian hoạt động trên tất cả các hệ điều hành máy tính hiện nay bao gồm macOS, Windows, và Linux.\nObsidian cho điện thoại, máy tính bảng\nBạn có thể sử dụng Obsidian trên thiết bị di động iOS như iPhone, iPad hoặc nền tảng Android tùy ý. Trên các máy tính bảng Windows, bạn có thể tải phiên bản ARM trong link download ở trên.\nCài đặt mẫu Obsidian Go¶ Giới thiệu\nObsidian Go V3 là mẫu thiết lập Obsidian được giới thiệu bởi Thịnh Vũ - tác giả của LEarn Anything và Thinh Vu Blog giúp các bạn mới có thể tận dụng toàn bộ cấu hình mẫu được giới thiệu bao gồm các thiết lập và plugin khuyên dùng để sử dụng ngay lập tức.\nObsidian là công cụ soạn thảo văn bản và quản lý kiến thức cho cá nhân có tính tùy biến cao. Khi bước vào thế giới của Obsidian, bạn sẽ cần dành nhiều thời gian để làm quen với bộ công cụ và phương thức làm việc mới so với các công cụ truyền thống. Obsidian V3 giúp rút ngắn việc tự “đốt đuốc tìm đường” của các bạn nhiều lần bởi khi cài đặt xong gói phần mềm, mọi thứ đều thô sơ và bạn sẽ choáng ngợp với trải nghiệm mới mà không biết bắt đầu từ đâu.\nTriết lý Cấu hình vault¶ Hầu hết các phần cài đặt trong Obsidian vault 1 đã được tùy biến tối ưu nhất theo quan điểm sử dụng của Thịnh, các tùy biến này ưu tiên việc ít tác động tới cài đặt gốc nhất nhưng giúp việc sử dụng thuận tiện.\nCác thành phần chính¶ Cách sử dụng Obsidian Go V3¶ Để sử dụng thư mục cấu hình sẵn Obsidian Go, bạn thực hiện theo các bước như sau:\nTải file zip về máy tính từ link Github repo tại đây\nDownload\nClick để mở xem hình minh họa\nChọn bản phát hành mới nhất\nChọn file zip để tải về\nGiải nén file zip để có thư mục bên trong Chép thư mục này vào máy tính của bạn: \u003e Hướng dẫn này mặc định hiểu bạn có nhu cầu đồng bộ các ghi chú giữa nhiều thiết bị (tất yếu), do đó bạn cần chọn 1 dịch vụ đám mây để làm phương tiện đồng bọ. Nếu không có nhu cầu đồng bộ dữ liệu với các thiết bị khác. Bạn chỉ cần chép thư mục vừa giải nén vào vị trí bất kỳ trên thiết bị. macOS: chép vào thư mục của dịch vụ iCloud, OneDrive (tôi đang sử dụng), hoặc Google Drive. Nếu sử dụng Obsidian trên iPhone thì chỉ dùng iCloud để đồng bộ, nếu dùng thiết bị Android thì chọn OneDrive, Google Drive, vv. Windows: chép vào thư mục OneDrive, Google Drive, hoặc bất kỳ ứng dụng Cloud nào bạn chọn. Android: Đặt ở thư mục gốc là được. Bạn sẽ cần dùng thêm ứng dụng FolderSync để đồng bộ với Cloud nếu muốn. iPhone/iPad: Bật đồng bộ thư mục trên từ iCloud sau khi lưu từ macbook. Chọn Open folder as Vault từ Obsidian để mở thư mục cấu hình sẵn để sử dụng trên thiết bị di động của bạn. Lưu ý\nBạn cần cài đặt ứng dụng OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, vv trên máy tính (client) để đồng bộ dữ liệu với thiết bị di động.\n",

Trước đây, mọi tùy chỉnh được thực hiện trong mẫu sẽ bị ghi đè bất cứ khi nào bạn cập nhật mẫu , khiến việc duy trì trở nên khó khăn nếu bạn muốn có bản cập nhật mới nhất.\nMẫu hiện có khái niệm về vị trí, nơi bạn có thể thêm bất kỳ nội dung nào bạn muốn. Có thể là Javascript, HTML hoặc CSS.\nCác vị trí có sẵn Ghi chú Không gian tên Đây là các không gian tên hiện được hỗ trợ cho ghi chú:\nchung Sẽ được thêm vào cả trang chủ và tất cả các trang ghi chú mục lục Sẽ được thêm vào trang chủ ghi chú Sẽ được thêm vào tất cả các trang ghi chú Máy đánh bạc Đây là các khe cắm được hỗ trợ:\ncái đầu Sẽ được đặt bên trong \u003chead\u003ethẻ html tiêu đề Sẽ được đặt ở đầu trang, trong \u003cheader\u003ethẻ, sau thẻ và tiêu đề ghi chú nếu tính năng này được bật trướcNội dung Sẽ được đặt ngay trước nội dung trang sauNội dung Sẽ được đặt ngay sau nội dung trang chân trang Sẽ được đặt ở chân trang Cây tập tin Không gian tên cây tập tin Máy đánh bạc trướcTiêu đề sauTiêu đề Không gian tên cây tập tin Máy đánh bạc đứng đầu đáy Làm thế nào nó hoạt động?

Đừng lo lắng nếu bạn không biết nó. Bạn không cần phải sử dụng bất kỳ tính năng nào. Đơn giản chỉ cần viết HTML vani sẽ hoạt động. Nếu bạn muốn thêm tập lệnh, hãy nhớ thêm tập lệnh đó vào trong thẻ tập lệnh:\n\u003cscript\u003e console.log(\"hello\") \u003c/script\u003eĐiều quan trọng là phần mở rộng tệp được sử dụng là “njk”.\nNếu bạn không muốn nội tuyến tập lệnh của mình mà muốn đặt chúng trong một jstệp riêng biệt, bạn có thể đặt chúng vào src/site/scriptsthư mục. Sau đó chúng có thể được tham chiếu như thế này trong njktệp của bạn:\n\u003cscript src=\"/scripts/your-script.js\" /\u003eVí dụ Ví dụ: để thêm nội dung phổ biến vào mỗi tiêu đề trang ngay sau tiêu đề và thẻ, tệp phải được đặt trong thư mục sau:\nsrc/site/_includes/components/user/common/header/Giả sử bạn có một hệ thống nhận xét được triển khai trong một tệp (ví dụ comment.njk: ) và bạn chỉ muốn sử dụng hệ thống đó trong các trang ghi chú, hãy đặt nó vào đường dẫn sau:\nsrc/site/_includes/components/user/notes/footer/comment.njkDữ liệu người dùng tùy chỉnh Nếu bạn muốn tính toán một số dữ liệu trong bất kỳ *.njktệp tùy chỉnh nào của mình, bạn có thể sửa đổi src/helpers/userUtils.jstệp.

Ví dụ: userUtils.jstệp sau:\n// Put your computations here. function userComputed(data) { return { city: 'Bergen', weather: [\"rain\", \"rain\", \"rain\"] }; } exports.userComputed = userComputed; ..nên làm cho thuộc tính thành phố và thời tiết có sẵn trong các mẫu của bạn như sau:\nCSS/SCSS động CSS/SCSS động Bất kỳ tệp css/scss nào được đặt bên dưới src/site/styles/user sẽ tự động được liên kết vào phần đầu ngay sau tất cả các kiểu dáng khác. Có nghĩa là kiểu dáng được thêm vào ở đây sẽ chiếm ưu thế hơn mọi thứ khác.\nHãy nhớ rằng, đường dẫn cho một vị trí nhất định luôn được sắp xếp theo tên tệp. Do đó, nếu thứ tự quan trọng, bạn nên đặt tên tệp sao cho chúng duy trì thứ tự bảng chữ cái.\nVí dụ trong tự nhiên Để bắt đầu và xem ví dụ trực tiếp, hãy xem khu vườn của uroybd , topobon của người dùng GitHub .
